 ### Conceptual Missing Pieces & Platform Differences
  Since this repository's optimization loop is tailored specifically for Claude Code, there are several key conceptual differences and minor blockages we need to address before we can cleanly run the loop under the
  Antigravity agent platform:

  #### 1. Slash Command & Skill Execution Engine

  • Claude Code Design: Claude Code natively parses custom slash commands (like  /start-experiment  or  /loop ) by loading and executing the instructions inside  .claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md .
  • Antigravity Execution: We do not have a native, platform-level "slash command interceptor" that reads and parses  SKILL.md  files automatically when you type a slash command.
  • Resolution: This is not a hard blocker. We are a fully capable agent with deep tool access ( view_file ,  run_command ,  schedule ,  ask_question ). We can easily read  .claude/skills/start-experiment/SKILL.md 
  ourselves, follow its steps manually, and orchestrate the loop on your behalf.

  #### 2. Empty Cluster Inventory ( .env/  directory)

  • Claude Code Design: The  /start-experiment  skill (Steps 5 & 6) discovers and filters candidate clusters by listing and parsing Markdown configurations in the  .env/  folder.
  • Current State: The  .env/  directory in our checkout is empty (it only contains  .gitkeep ).
  • Why it's a blocker: If we ran  /start-experiment  immediately, Step 5 would fail to find any matching clusters (for v6e-8 or any other topology), preventing us from performing the occupancy checks and selecting
  target hardware.
  • Resolution: I have proactively started the  .claude/scripts/scan-gke-clusters.sh  script in the background for our active GCP project ( cloud-tpu-multipod-dev ). Once it completes, we will use it to populate  .   
  env/gke-tpu-cluster-scan.md , satisfying the  /start-experiment  prerequisite.

  #### 3. IDE-Level Stop Hook Integration

  • Claude Code Design: Claude Code wires up  stop_hook.sh  under  .claude/settings.local.json  to intercept termination attempts, preventing the agent from giving up prematurely on active loops unless a retrospective
  file has been written to  wiki/analyses/  in the last 6 hours.
  • Current State: Our execution environment does not have a shell/IDE-level hook to catch and block "stop" instructions.
  • Resolution: We can self-enforce this guardrail! Since we can read the  .claude/.loop_active.json  marker ourselves and understand the rules of the retrospective, we will voluntarily refuse to conclude a loop or
  declare a lane exhausted unless we have completed the required retrospective audit first.

  #### 4. Session ID Resolution Hacking

  • Claude Code Design: Step 9a in  start-experiment/SKILL.md  uses a bash finding script inside  ~/.claude/projects/  to locate the latest  .jsonl  transcript and extract Claude's active Session ID.
  • Current State: Under Antigravity, transcripts are stored in our own App Data directory ( /home/alekseyv_google_com/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain/ ), meaning the verbatim bash snippet would fail to resolve our ID.
  • Resolution: We can completely bypass this hack. We are directly provided with our active Conversation ID ( 3b337c5b-9459-41e8-89af-b1f1b12e805a ) in our environment metadata. We will write this ID directly to  .  
  claude/.loop_active.json , ensuring the never-stop marker works flawlessly.

  #### 5. Native Looping via the  schedule  Tool

  • Claude Code Design: Claude Code relies on external harnesses or self-paced interval execution.
  • Antigravity Advantage: We have a native, highly reliable  schedule  tool (offering both one-shot timers and background recurring cron schedules) which can wake us up dynamically. We can use this native tool to run
  /loop  iterations with absolute precision.

for   #### 1. Slash Command & Skill Execution Engine, can you add instructions to /mnt/disks/persist/torch-tpu/tpu_performance_autoresearch_wiki_ag/GEMINI.md to review and remember claude skills and agents that you
  should be able to use to run this flow

-> good update for GEMINI.md

can we rename experiment prefix to be qwen3_ag_ instead of qwen3_cc_ ?

can you run latest qwen3 jax experiment on v6e8 to reproduce baseline
