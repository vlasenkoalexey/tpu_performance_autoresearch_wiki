"""Offline autotuning for pre-compiled JAX computations.

This module provides utilities for autotuning kernel configurations
based on lowered (compiled but not yet executed) JAX computations.
It enables optimization of kernels based on the actual operations
that will be executed, rather than relying on heuristics.

Key Functions:
    autotune_lowered: Autotune all ejkernel operations found in a lowered computation

The offline tuning workflow:
    1. Lower a JAX function to get compiled representation
    2. Extract ejkernel operation labels from the HLO code
    3. Match labels to recorded invocations in the registry
    4. Run autotuning for each matched operation
    5. Store optimal configurations in cache

Example:
    >>> lowered = jax.jit(my_function).lower(example_args)
    >>> result = autotune_lowered(selector, lowered)
    >>> with result:  # Apply optimized configurations
    ...     output = jax.jit(my_function)(real_args)

    Analyzes a lowered JAX computation to identify all ejkernel operations,

    Returns:

        Only operations that have been previously recorded in the invocation
        registry will be tuned. Use EJKERNEL_OPS_RECORD=1 environment variable
        to enable invocation recording during initial runs.
