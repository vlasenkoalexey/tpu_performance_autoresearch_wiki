"""Metadata extraction and label processing for compiled JAX programs.

This module provides utilities for working with compilation metadata and
labels embedded in JAX compiled programs. It enables extraction of operation
identifiers and configuration mappings from compiled HLO code.

Key Functions:
    label: Generate standardized labels for operations
    extract_labels_from_hlo_text: Find all ejkernel labels in HLO text
    find_labels_in_lowered: Extract labels from lowered JAX computations
    labels_to_configs: Map found labels back to their configurations

Label Format:
    Labels follow the pattern: 'ejkernel_ops#operation@version:hash'
    Example: 'ejkernel_ops#matmul@v1:1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h'

These utilities enable:
    - Tracking which operations were compiled with which configurations
    - Post-compilation analysis of optimization choices
    - Debugging and profiling of specific operation instances
    - Configuration recovery from compiled programs

Example Usage:
    >>>
    >>> op_label = label('matmul@v1', '1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h')
    >>> print(op_label)
    >>>
    >>>
    >>> lowered = jax.jit(my_function).lower(args)
    >>> labels = find_labels_in_lowered(lowered)
    >>>
    >>>
    >>> configs = labels_to_configs(lowered, selector)
