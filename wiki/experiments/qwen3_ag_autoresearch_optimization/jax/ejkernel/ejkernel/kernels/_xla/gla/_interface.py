    """
    Computes Gated Linear Attention (GLA) in a recurrent, linear-time manner using JAX/XLA.
    This function provides a convenient wrapper around the core `recurrent`
    implementation, tailored for GLA. It processes sequences step-by-step,
    making it highly efficient for very long sequences and suitable for
    autoregressive decoding.
    It supports both standard batch processing and variable-length sequence
    processing using cumulative sequence lengths (`cu_seqlens`).
    Args:
        query: The query tensor. Expected shape is `(batch, seq_len, num_heads, head_dim)`
            or `(total_tokens, num_heads, head_dim)` if `cu_seqlens` is used.
        key: The key tensor. Must have the same shape as `q`.
        value: The value tensor. Must have the same shape as `q`.
        g: The gate tensor, specific to Gated Linear Attention. If provided, it
            should have the same shape as `q`.
        g_gamma: The gate decay factor.
        softmax_scale: A scaling factor applied to the query before the recurrent
            computation. If `None`, it defaults to `1 / sqrt(head_dim)`.
        initial_state: The initial hidden state for the recurrence. Useful for
            chunked processing of long sequences.
        reverse: If `True`, the sequence is processed in reverse order.
        cu_seqlens: Cumulative sequence lengths for variable-length inputs.
            This is a 1D tensor like `[0, len_seq1, len_seq1+len_seq2, ...]`.
            If provided, the input tensors `query, key, value, g` are expected to be
            "packed" with a shape of `(total_tokens, ...)`.
    Returns:
        A tuple containing:
            - o (jax.Array): The output tensor, with the same shape as `q`.
            - final_state (jax.Array): The final hidden state of the recurrence,
              which can be used as `initial_state` for a subsequent segment.
    Raises:
        ValueError: If `cu_seqlens` is provided and the batch size of `q` is
            not 1.
        ValueError: If `cu_seqlens` is provided and the number of initial states
            does not match the number of sequences.
    Examples:
        >>>
        >>> q = jnp.ones((2, 100, 8, 64))
        >>> k = jnp.ones((2, 100, 8, 64))
        >>> v = jnp.ones((2, 100, 8, 64))
        >>> g = jnp.ones((2, 100, 8, 64))
        >>> output, final_state = recurrent_gla(query, key, value, g=g)
        >>> output.shape
        (2, 100, 8, 64)
        >>>
        >>> q = jnp.ones((150, 8, 64))
        >>> k = jnp.ones((150, 8, 64))
        >>> v = jnp.ones((150, 8, 64))
        >>> g = jnp.ones((150, 8, 64))
        >>> cu_seqlens = jnp.array([0, 50, 100, 150])
        >>> output, final_state = recurrent_gla(query, key, value, g=g, cu_seqlens=cu_seqlens)
        >>> output.shape
        (150, 8, 64)
