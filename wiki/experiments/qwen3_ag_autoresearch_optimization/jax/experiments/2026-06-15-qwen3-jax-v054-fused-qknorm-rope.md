# qwen3-jax-v054-fused-qknorm-rope

## Hypothesis under test

**Hypothesis**: The Qwen3 architecture uniquely applies RMSNorm to Q and K immediately before applying RoPE. In the XLA implementation, this requires materializing the full `[B, S, H, D]` tensors between the norm and the RoPE operation, leading to significant HBM bandwidth pressure and HLO fragmentation. By fusing RMSNorm and RoPE into a single Pallas kernel, we can keep the intermediate normalized values in SRAM/VMEM and only write the final RoPE'd vectors to HBM, saving two memory traversals and ~2-3pp MFU.

**Mechanism**: Write a custom Pallas kernel `fused_qknorm_rope` that takes un-normalized `q` and `k`, the norm weights, and the RoPE frequencies. Inside the block, it computes the RMSNorm denominator, applies the scale, and then immediately applies the RoPE rotation. Substitute `jnp.einsum`/`rmsnorm` followed by `apply_rotary_emb` with this kernel call in `model/modeling_qwen3.py`. 

**Predicted signal**: expect `custom_call(target=fused_qknorm_rope)` to appear in train_step module, and HBM memory traffic bucket to drop due to avoiding materialization of intermediate Q and K after RMSNorm.

**Falsification criterion**: If the step time does not improve by at least 2% MFU (or the compiled memory footprint is not reduced), then the fusion is bottlenecked by compute or Pallas launch overhead rather than memory bandwidth, and the hypothesis is refuted.

## Setup

## Results
The workload crashed on launch with `bash: cd: wiki/experiments/qwen3_ag_autoresearch_optimization/jax: No such file or directory`. This is because the `launch_cmd` included a `cd` step that is invalid in the Docker container where the `WORKDIR` is already set to `/app/trainer`.

## Profile
missing

## HLO Dump
missing

## Verdict
**Refuted (Crash)**. The launch command was malformed for the container environment.
