type: experiment
model: qwen3-cc-jax
variant: 8B/v6e-8
hypothesis: "In `v057-t`, perfectly configuring block rematerialization (custom outer policy saving 3.75GB boundaries + nothing_saveable inner barriers) proved that `batch_size=8` at `seqlen=8192` (65,536 tokens/chip) is physically impossible due to HLO temp buffer requirements exceeding 31.25GB during the backward pass recomputation. By reducing `batch_size` to 4 (32,768 tokens/chip) while keeping the same mathematically sound nested checkpointing strategy, the peak temp memory requirements will halve, allowing the model to successfully compile and run with Tokamax CE and Splash Attention."

# qwen3-jax-v057-u-nested-ckpt-bs4

## Hypothesis under test

**Hypothesis**: Lowering `batch_size` to 4 while using the `v057-t` nested checkpointing strategy successfully compiles and runs.

**Mechanism**:
1. Keep `Qwen3Block` with `K=4` layers.
2. Apply custom `False` policy to `Qwen3Block` checkpoint.
3. Ensure `jax.checkpoint(layer._call_impl, policy=jax.checkpoint_policies.nothing_saveable)` inside `Qwen3DecoderLayer`.
4. Keep `jax.checkpoint(loss_fn)` in `train.py` WITHOUT any policy.
5. Set `batch_size=4` (per chip).
6. Use Tokamax CE and Splash Attention.

**Predicted signal**: The model will compile quickly (<5 mins) and train successfully at `batch_size=4`, `seqlen=8192`. This will establish the baseline MFU.

**Falsification criterion**: HBM OOM, VMEM OOM, or compiler hang.

## Setup

Cluster: `charles-v6e`
