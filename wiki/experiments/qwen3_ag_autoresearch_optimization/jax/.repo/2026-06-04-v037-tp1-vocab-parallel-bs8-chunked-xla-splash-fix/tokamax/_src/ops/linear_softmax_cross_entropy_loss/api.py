  """The linear softmax cross-entropy loss op.

  The Linear Softmax Cross-Entropy Loss Op is a tokamax Op that performs a
  linear projection and cross entropy loss calculation
  `loss = -reduction(labels * log(softmax(X@W)))`
  where reduction is either sum or mean.
  This op uses the regular (unsafe) Cross-Entropy loss function
  (Like `optax.softmax_cross_entropy()`) so the logits `X@W` cannot be `-inf`

  Args:
    x: The last layer output in the dimension of (B, H) where B is batch size
      and H is the hidden dimension.
    labels: The ground truth labels index in the dimension of (B,).
    weights: The linear projection weight matrix in the dimension of (H, V)
      where V is the dimension of the output logits aka vocabulary size.
    reduction: The reduction method for the cross entropy loss. Can be set to
      "sum" or "mean" explicitly.
    precision: The precision used for jax.lax.dot_general for the linear
      projection and gradient calculation.
    implementation: By default "None" will be used to pick the best available
      backend. Can be set to "mosaic_tpu", "xla" or "chunked_xla" explicitly.
      The "mosaic_tpu" and "chunked_xla" implementations are memory efficient
      and have almost 0 additional buffer overhead while the "xla"
      implementation needs to materialize the full logits.

  Returns:
    The Cross-Entropy loss

  Raises:
    NotImplementedError: If the implementation is not supported.
    ExceptionGroup: If all implementations failed.
