# Qwen3 JAX v079 - shard acts s8k bs3 tokamax splash layer multicompute overlap rerun

## Hypothesis under test

**Hypothesis**: v078's `--xla_tpu_enable_multi_compute_overlap_in_layer_scheduler=true`
run produced a valid but tiny single-worker high-water mark: 51,025 tok/s
versus the confirmed v074/v075 51,021 tok/s frontier. An exact rerun will show
whether this is a durable scheduler improvement or ordinary run-to-run noise.

**Mechanism**: Exact rerun of v078.

**Predicted signal**: Both workers remain in or above the v074/v075 band, with
at least one worker at or above 51,021 tok/s and no profile regression.

**Falsification criterion**: Clean completion below the v074/v075 band, or a
profile matching v078 without repeatable throughput gain.

## Setup

Planned GKE workload `alekseyv-qwen3-v079-multicomp-rerun`.

- **Image**: `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/tpu-pytorch/torchtitan-images/qwen3-8b-jax:v041-shard-acts`
- **Run dir**: `gs://tpu-pytorch-alekseyv-us-central2/autoresearch/qwen3_cc/2026-06-04-qwen3-jax-v079-shard-acts-s8k-bs3-tokamax-splash-layer-multicompute-overlap-rerun`
- **Mesh**: `fsdp=8,tp=1`
- **Environment**: `USE_TOKAMAX_SPLASH=1 TOKAMAX_MAX_LOGIT_CONST=30.0`
- **XLA flag stack**: v074/v075 plus
  `--xla_tpu_enable_multi_compute_overlap_in_layer_scheduler=true`
- **Command shape**: `--use_scan=True --use_remat=True --use_splash=True --use_maxtext_ce=True --shard_acts=True --batch_size=3 --seqlen=8192 --tp_parallelism=1`
- **Global batch**: 24
- **Profile window**: steps 12-14

## Results

Workload `alekseyv-qwen3-v079-multicomp-rerun` completed cleanly on
2026-06-04 with normal loss.

- Worker 0: 51,021 tok/s, 36.6% MFU
- Worker 1: 51,009 tok/s, 36.6% MFU
- Final loss: 12.0508 on both workers
- Exit code: 0

This confirms that v078's multi-compute-overlap flag is non-harmful and in the
frontier band, but it does not reproduce v078's 51,025 tok/s single-worker
high-water mark.

- Peak HBM: 28.32 GiB of 31.25 GiB; 2.93 GiB free; 0.05% fragmentation

## HLO Dump

No HLO objects were written for v079, consistent with a persistent
compilation-cache hit for the exact v078 graph. Use v078 HLO:

- HLO object count: 1,615
- Train-step after-optimization size: 1,375,271 bytes
- Flagfile confirms
  `--xla_tpu_enable_multi_compute_overlap_in_layer_scheduler='true'` with
  v076 resource sharing and v077 Mosaic custom-call async fusion both false.

## Verdict

Supported/tie. The multi-compute-overlap flag is valid and stays in the
frontier band, but the rerun does not establish a durable improvement beyond
the confirmed 51,021 tok/s band.
