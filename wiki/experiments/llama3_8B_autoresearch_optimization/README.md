# Llama 3 8B — TPU Autoresearch Optimization

A long-running research program that imports Meta's **Llama 3 8B** via Hugging Face, gets it running on TPU through **torchax** (PyTorch-on-JAX), optionally converts to native JAX, and applies the Karpathy-style **autoresearch loop** to optimize its performance on TPU.

**This is an optimization program, not a quality program.** Per the wiki's scope rule, any change that alters model semantics (output distribution, accuracy, convergence) is invalid — regardless of speedup. We optimize step time, MFU, tokens/sec, and memory only. Outputs of the optimized model must match the reference within bf16 numerical tolerance.

Individual experiments for this program live as dated files in **this folder**: `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md`. Working scripts and configs are split by execution path: [`torchax/`](torchax/README.md) (primary — PyTorch-on-JAX) and [`jax/`](jax/README.md) (secondary — native-JAX port). Profiles for each experiment are captured to `raw/profiles/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>/`. See the "Schema note" section at the bottom.

## TL;DR — current state (2026-04-27)

🏆 **Frontier**: native-JAX (Flax NNX) stack at **~7,700 tok/s/chip / 43.3 % MFU** on v6e-8 at `bs=4 seq=8192 fsdp=8` (mean of 3 reruns; peak run 7,768/43.6 %). Loss-validated bit-equivalent to a minimal-flags baseline over 100 training steps (max \|Δ\| = 0.0003). Bf16-MXU optimization regime is empirically saturated — only int8/AQT remains as a viable per-chip throughput lever.

### Cross-stack comparison (Llama 3 / 3.1 8B, v6e-8, bs configured per stack, seq=8192)

| Stack | Best config | tok/s/chip | MFU (reported) | MFU (causal-norm.) | vs MaxText (TPS) | Reference experiment |
|-------|-------------|-----------:|----:|----:|-----------:|----------------------|
| 🏆 **JAX (Flax NNX)** | bs=4, full MaxText XLA stack + SC offload of AR/RS/AG + tokamax-splash w/ base2/fuse_recip/mlc=30 + tokamax CE chunked_xla + scan/`nothing_saveable` | **~7,700** (peak 7,768) | **~43.3 %** (peak 43.6 %) | **~43.3 %** (peak 43.6 %) | **+8.9 %** (peak +9.9 %) | [JAX exp 27/28b](jax/experiments/2026-04-26-jax-exp27-28-sparsecore-rs-ag-offload-frontier.md) |
| MaxText reference | bs=3, `tpu-recipes-v0.1.4` recipe `llama3_1_8b_8192_no_collective_matmul` (host-offload of activations + custom remat + AR-only SC offload) | 7,069 | 44.6 % (pre-`/2`, non-causal) | **39.6 %** | — (anchor) | [MaxText baseline](maxtext/experiments/2026-04-25-maxtext-llama3-1-8b-v6e8-baseline.md) |
| torchax (PyTorch-on-JAX) | bs=3, scan + tokamax CE chunked_xla + tokamax-splash w/ base2/fuse_recip/mlc=30 + AMP fp32-master | 6,559 | 36.8 % | 36.8 % | -7.2 % | [torchax exp 72a/74b](torchax/experiments/2026-04-26-exp72a-tokamax-splash-bs3-seq8k-accepted.md) |
| torchax (morning baseline) | bs=2 seq=1024, no scan/tokamax, plain AMP | 4,591 | 22.9 % (at seq=1024) | 22.9 % (seq=1024) | — | [torchax baseline](torchax/experiments/2026-04-25-baseline.md) |

*The **MFU (causal-norm.)** column normalizes all stacks to the same FLOP accounting (causal attention, ÷2) — see [MaxText MFU is reported on a stale non-causal basis](#maxtext-mfu-is-reported-on-a-stale-non-causal-basis) below. JAX and torchax already count causally; only MaxText's reference number changes (44.6 % → 39.6 %). On this consistent basis the JAX frontier beats MaxText on **both** MFU and throughput.*

**JAX vs torchax (same hardware, same model, both at their best)**: **+17.4 % per-chip** — the native-JAX port closes its 17 % gap to MaxText and then beats it; torchax has a residual ~7 % gap to MaxText that's not closeable by knob-tuning under the current scaffold (further wins would require torchax dispatch-overhead reduction at the framework level or kernel-level changes already in the JAX path).

**JAX vs MaxText** (the +8.9 % / +9.9 % win): **the bf16-MXU path is faster than MaxText on v6e-8 at 8 K context**. The 1.0 pp "reported MFU gap" is a FLOP-accounting artifact — **the recipe's MaxText reference counts attention non-causally, while our stacks (and current MaxText code) apply the causal ÷2** (see [MaxText MFU is reported on a stale non-causal basis](#maxtext-mfu-is-reported-on-a-stale-non-causal-basis) below). On MaxText's non-causal accounting we measure **49.0 % MFU** on the same throughput (**+4.4 pp above their 44.6 %**); on the causal basis both shift down and the JAX frontier's **43.6 % beats MaxText's 39.6 %** — either way the MFU win equals the throughput win. Profile breakdown of the JAX frontier: matmul 60.1 %, splash 25.5 %, loop fusion 9.2 %, async-collective 1.7 %, **TC idle 0.014 % (saturated)**.

**Cumulative session climb**: torchax morning baseline 4,591 tok/s/chip → JAX exp 28b 7,768 tok/s/chip = **+69.2 % per-chip throughput** in two days.

### MaxText MFU is reported on a stale (non-causal) basis

The MaxText `44.6 %` reference is **not** on the same FLOP basis as the JAX/torchax MFU — which is what makes the "−1 pp MFU but +9.9 % throughput" look paradoxical. Checking the code resolves it:

- **Our stacks count attention causally (`÷2`).** Only the lower triangle of the attention score matrix executes under a causal mask, so `jax/train.py:543` computes `4·B·L²·Hq·hd / 2`. This is the physically-accurate FLOP count.
- **The MaxText reference we ran does not.** The `2026-04-25` baseline ran `tpu-recipes-v0.1.4`, which prints `409.4 TFLOP/s/device` — **non-causal** (full attention): `409.4e12 ÷ 7,069.7 tok/s = 5.79e10 FLOPs/token`, exactly the no-`/2` count → 44.6 %.
- **Current MaxText code *does* apply the causal `/2`.** `src/maxtext/utils/maxtext_utils.py:905`: `causal_attention_flops = noncausal_attention_flops / 2`, reached for llama3.1-8b via `decoder_block: "llama2"` → the generic dense branch (line 969). This `/2` was a **recent** fix (commit `6288c233`, 2026-04-11); `tpu-recipes-v0.1.4` pins a *pre-fix* MaxText, so the published recipe ceiling is still non-causal.
- **On the causal basis MaxText llama3-8b ≈ 39.6 % MFU**, not 44.6 % (409.4 → 363.9 TFLOP/s = ×0.889; 363.9 ÷ 918). For that same baseline run, *current* MaxText would print ≈ 39.6 %.

So on a consistent (causal) basis — the convention both our stacks **and** current MaxText use — the JAX frontier (**43.6 %**) beats MaxText (**39.6 %**) by ≈ **+9.9 %**, exactly matching the throughput margin. The only way 43.6 % looks "below MaxText" is comparing our causal number against the recipe's stale non-causal 44.6 %. **Throughput (+8.9 % / +9.9 %) is convention-free and is the comparison to trust.**

> [!note] Follow-up: re-measure the MaxText llama3-8b reference on the current causal-`/2` build (or recompute 409.4 → 363.9 TFLOP/s) to replace the stale 44.6 % anchor with ≈ 39.6 %. Until then the maxtext-baseline page's 44.6 % is non-causal and not comparable to the JAX/torchax MFU.

### Open + refuted hypotheses (post-frontier)

- **Open**: [int8 weight-only quantization (AQT/qwix)](../../hypotheses/llama3-jax-int8-weight-quantization.md) — expected +15-30 % step time, would shift onto the 2× int8-MXU path and break the 65.8 % bf16-MXU ceiling.
- ~~Pallas RMSNorm + matmul-prologue fusion~~ — **refuted via HLO inspection** 2026-04-27. XLA already inlines RMSNorm into each matmul's `kind=kOutput` Mosaic kernel.
- ~~Pallas SwiGLU + down_proj fusion~~ — **refuted via HLO inspection** 2026-04-27. XLA already fuses silu+mult+down_proj+residual into a single `kind=kOutput` kernel.

The HLO refutation was the methodology highlight of this program: a 30-minute `XLA_FLAGS=--xla_dump_to=…` capture + grep saved 2-4 weeks of Pallas-kernel work. See [`raw/profiles/2026-04-27-jax-hlodump-exp28b/`](../../../raw/profiles/2026-04-27-jax-hlodump-exp28b/) for the preserved HLO evidence.

## Target metrics

| Metric | Direction | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Step time (training) | ↓ | Wall-clock per training step, excluding compile / warmup. |
| Per-token latency (inference) | ↓ | Decode step latency for autoregressive generation. |
| MFU | ↑ | Model FLOPs Utilization against v6e bf16 peak. |
| Tokens/sec | ↑ | Aggregate throughput (training) or generation rate (inference). |
| Tokens/chip/sec | ↑ | Normalizing TPS per chip. |
| Peak HBM | ↓ | Enables larger batch / longer seq / fewer shards. |

## Hardware

- **Primary**: TPU v6e (Trillium) — the target platform.
- **Reference**: TPU v5e / v5p if available (for generation-comparative roofline calibration).
- **Out-of-scope**: GPU (performance claims from GPU sources are calibration-only, not portable).

## Model

- Source: [meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B).
- Architecture: Llama 3 family (GQA attention, SwiGLU FFN, RMSNorm, RoPE). Confirm exact config on baseline ingest.
- Initial precision: bf16 weights + bf16 activations + fp32 optimizer states; `default_matmul_precision='bfloat16'`.

## How to run

Scripts live in [`torchax/`](torchax/README.md) (primary, where optimizations are explored), [`jax/`](jax/README.md) (secondary, native-JAX port), and [`maxtext/`](maxtext/README.md) (reference baseline — runs upstream MaxText recipes verbatim as a measured ceiling for the other two stacks to target). The runbook below reproduces the torchax [2026-04-25 baseline](torchax/experiments/2026-04-25-baseline.md). For the current MaxText reference number on v6e-8 see [maxtext/experiments/2026-04-25-maxtext-llama3-1-8b-v6e8-baseline.md](maxtext/experiments/2026-04-25-maxtext-llama3-1-8b-v6e8-baseline.md) (**409.4 TFLOP/s/device, 7,069.7 TPS, 44.6 % MFU**).

### Prerequisites

- A TPU v6e host (v6e-4 or v6e-8). `jax.device_count()` drives the FSDP mesh — whatever's visible is what's used.
- [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed.
- A Hugging Face account; accept the Llama 3 license once at [huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B) (Apache-2.0, not gated, but login is still required for the hub). About 15 GB of free disk for the weights cache.

### One-time setup

```bash
# From the wiki repo root.
cd /mnt/disks/persist/torch-tpu/tpu_performance_autoresearch_wiki

# Create the env and activate it (activate it once per shell from here on).
conda create -n llama3_py313 python=3.13 -y
conda activate llama3_py313

# Python deps.
pip install -r wiki/experiments/llama3_autoresearch_optimization/torchax/requirements.txt
# torchax from the local submodule (matches the wiki's pinned commit).
pip install -e raw/code/torchax
# transformers needs accelerate for device-map handling on recent versions.
pip install accelerate

# Hugging Face auth.
pip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"
hf auth login
```

### Smoke run — reproduces the baseline

```bash
# Activate the env once per shell (skip if already active).
conda activate llama3_py313

# Anchor the profile path at the repo root; run from the torchax folder so
# that `python -m train` finds its sibling `model/` and `data.py` modules.
WIKI_ROOT="/mnt/disks/persist/torch-tpu/tpu_performance_autoresearch_wiki"
PROFILE_DIR="$WIKI_ROOT/raw/profiles/2026-04-25-llama3-smoke"
mkdir -p "$PROFILE_DIR"

cd "$WIKI_ROOT/wiki/experiments/llama3_autoresearch_optimization/torchax"
python -m train \
  --steps 20 \
  --batch_size 1 \
  --seq_len 1024 \
  --profile_dir "$PROFILE_DIR" \
  --profile_steps 5 6 7
```

**Expected output on v6e-4**: step 0 + step 1 each compile for ~150 s; steady-state from step 2 onward is **~134 ms/step** at seq=1024 (the [2026-04-25 baseline](torchax/experiments/2026-04-25-baseline.md) reports the full seq-length sweep). Loss descends from ~3.9 to ~2.0 over 10 steps. Profile traces for steps 5–7 land under `$PROFILE_DIR`.

### Key flags

| Flag | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--strategy` | `fsdp` | `fsdp` shards every param's largest divisible dim across all chips (fine-tuning default). `tp` is Megatron-style. |
| `--fsdp` | `0` (auto = `jax.device_count()`) | Only used with `--strategy fsdp`. |
| `--dp` / `--tp` | `1 / 1` | Only used with `--strategy tp`. |
| `--batch_size` | `4` | Per-chip. Global = `batch_size × fsdp` (FSDP) or `× dp` (TP). |
| `--seq_len` | `2048` | **Known issue**: NaN loss at seq≥2048 on the current scaffold; seq≤1024 is clean. See the baseline page. |
| `--dtype` | `bf16` | `bf16` activates `torchax.enable_performance_mode()`. |
| `--profile_dir` / `--profile_steps` | unset | Set both to capture an xprof trace for the listed steps. |

### What lives where

- `torchax/train.py` — the trainer (argparse + train loop, ~500 lines).
- `torchax/model/sharding.py` — FSDP + TP sharding plans.
- `torchax/data.py` — `wikitext-2-raw-v1` loader + fixed-length packer.
- `torchax/run.sh` — convenience wrapper that sets `XLA_FLAGS` / `LIBTPU_INIT_ARGS` and forwards extra args.
- [`torchax/README.md`](torchax/README.md) — per-file detail + known limitations.

### Filing the experiment page

After a run:

1. Pick a slug: `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<short-description>.md` (e.g. `2026-04-24-splash-attention.md`).
2. Create the file next to this README (in `wiki/experiments/llama3_autoresearch_optimization/`) — follow the `experiment` page template in [`SCHEMA.md`](../../../SCHEMA.md). The [2026-04-25 baseline](torchax/experiments/2026-04-25-baseline.md) is the working example.
3. **Reference the profile**: the profile dir path goes in both `## Profile` and `## Sources`. Profiles are gitignored (`raw/profiles/*` in `.gitignore`), so the experiment page is the only lineage link on disk.
4. Append a `log.md` entry.

## How to start the optimization loop

The agent-facing protocol for this program lives in [`program.md`](program.md) — a self-contained adaptation of Karpathy's autoresearch for Llama 3 8B on torchax/v6e-4. **Read `program.md` first.** Every subsequent experiment follows it.

To start a session:

1. Read [`program.md`](program.md) end-to-end (~10 min). Resolve every fixed binding (hardware, conda env, baseline command, libtpu version, xprof_mcp server location).
2. Tail [`OBSERVATIONS.md`](torchax/experiments/OBSERVATIONS.md) for the latest state of the loop (what was kept, what was discarded, open follow-ups).
3. Tail [`RESULTS.tsv`](torchax/experiments/RESULTS.tsv) for the current ledger row and `status: keep` baseline.
4. Pick the next hypothesis per `program.md` §"The experiment loop", priority order (profile-driven → follow-up → wiki-driven → heuristics).
5. Run, profile, symlink, query xprof_mcp, diff vs baseline, write up per the template in `program.md`.
6. Decision + commit or revert per §"Decision". Append to the ledger + log.
7. Repeat.

The methodology itself is mutable — improvements surfaced during experimentation commit to `program.md` and log an entry under `## approach evolution` in `OBSERVATIONS.md`.

### Known issues encountered by the scaffold (baseline run)

See the "Scaffold changes applied during this run" table on [2026-04-25-baseline.md](torchax/experiments/2026-04-25-baseline.md). Short list:
- HF checkpoint is multimodal-only — `Llama4ForCausalLM.from_pretrained` silently re-initializes weights. Load `Llama4ForConditionalGeneration` and monkey-patch the forward (already done in `train.py`).
- NaN loss at seq≥2048 even with `final_logit_softcapping`; correctness work pending.
- Step 1 recompiles (~150 s, same as step 0). Low-effort follow-up: explicit `in_shardings` on `jax.jit`.
- OOM at batch=4, seq=2048 (attention N×N materialized, no splash).

## Code

Working scripts, notebooks, and configs are split by execution path:
- [`torchax/`](torchax/README.md) — **primary**: Llama 3 8B run via torchax (PyTorch-on-JAX). The baseline and most hypotheses exercise this path.
- [`jax/`](jax/README.md) — **secondary**: a native-JAX port of the model, lit up once the torchax baseline is stable and a port becomes a hypothesis (e.g., to drop dispatch overhead or reach JAX-only tooling more cheaply). A JAX port must reproduce the torchax baseline's outputs within bf16 tolerance before its numbers count.

Every dated experiment in this folder references the exact script + config used by relative path. Code is tracked in the main wiki git repo (not a submodule).

## Baseline

Not yet captured. Baseline experiment is the first hypothesis in the ranked list below.

| Metric | Value | Date | Experiment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Step time | TBD | — | — |
| MFU | TBD | — | — |
| Tokens/sec | TBD | — | — |
| Peak HBM | TBD | — | — |

## Current best

Same as baseline until the first experiment with `verdict: supported` lands.

## Known bottlenecks

*To be identified from the baseline profile. Candidates to look for based on Llama-family architecture and Wave 1/2 findings:*
- Attention kernel path — whether torchax routes to `tokamax.dot_product_attention` / Splash or falls back to a chunked XLA kernel.
- SwiGLU path — tokamax has no TPU Pallas kernel for [gated-linear-unit](../../concepts/gated-linear-unit.md); almost certainly XLA on TPU.
- RMSNorm path — similarly no TPU Pallas kernel for [layer-norm](../../concepts/layer-norm.md) in tokamax; likely XLA.
- Activation memory pressure — Llama-family E4B has depth + long-context activations that push HBM; candidate for [rematerialization](../../concepts/rematerialization.md) and [host-offload](../../concepts/host-offload.md).
- Captured-constants bloat — torchax jit'd functions can capture Python-held tensors as constants (see [jax-huggingface part 3](../../sources/2026-jax-huggingface-part-3.md) for a 13.48 GB instance).

## Open hypotheses

Ranked candidates consolidated from Wave 1/2 findings, the [xprof-mcp TPU optimization guide](../../sources/2026-xprof-mcp-tpu-optimization.md), and the [Ultra-Scale Playbook](../../sources/2025-ultrascale-playbook.md). Ranks are preliminary — will be refined once the baseline profile identifies which apply to this model.

## Retired hypotheses

*None yet.*

## History

- **2026-04-25**: Program filed. First baseline captured — see [2026-04-25-baseline.md](torchax/experiments/2026-04-25-baseline.md). Hardware was v6e-4 (not v6e-8 as the scaffold assumed). Steady-state at seq=2048, batch=1, FSDP=4: **249 ms/step, ~33k tokens/sec, ~26% MFU** (corrected from earlier `6PT` overestimate that claimed 44%). Loss is NaN at seq=2048 but clean at seq≤1024 — a correctness bug to fix before the first perf hypothesis lands.
- **2026-04-25**: 20-step confirmation run at seq=1024. Loss **3.93 → ~2.0** (noisy at global batch=4, but trending). Steady-state at seq=1024: **134.4 ± 0.5 ms/step**, ~30.5k tokens/sec.
- **2026-04-25**: [Exp 1](torchax/experiments/2026-04-25-exp1-async-collective-flags-rejected.md) — async-collective XLA flag bundle (`--xla_tpu_enable_latency_hiding_scheduler`, `--xla_tpu_enable_async_collective_fusion`, `+fuse_all_gather`, `+multiple_steps`) via `LIBTPU_INIT_ARGS`. **REFUTED**: 134.4 → 168.3 ms (+25 % regression). Scheduler reordered collectives but broke compute-fusion memory locality (convolution fusion +2.5× bytes, loop fusion +1.9× bytes). Correctness preserved. Flags parked, will revisit once larger effective batch is reachable.
- **2026-04-25**: [Exp 2](torchax/experiments/2026-04-25-exp2-pin-out-shardings-rejected.md) — attempted to pin `out_shardings` on `jax.jit` to fix the step-1 recompile. **CRASH** at trace time: tied-weight (`lm_head` ↔ `embed_tokens`) sharding plumbing collapsed to single-device for the duplicate key; jit rejected the mismatch. Reverted. Step-1 recompile remains open (~150 s/run iteration overhead).
- **2026-04-25**: Formalized the loop into [program.md](program.md) + [RESULTS.tsv](torchax/experiments/RESULTS.tsv) + [OBSERVATIONS.md](torchax/experiments/OBSERVATIONS.md). README trimmed to a runbook + pointer; the agent-facing protocol now lives in `program.md`. Experiments 1 and 2 retroactively transcribed to the ledger + observation log.

## Schema note

This folder is an **intentional deviation** from `SCHEMA.md` as originally written. The schema specifies `wiki/experiments/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md` (flat, one file per dated experiment). Here the experiments for one long-running optimization program are **nested under a program folder** so the program's plan (this `README.md`), its dated experiments, and optionally local code live together. See the log entry dated 2026-04-25 for the rationale.

Experiment files within this folder still follow the schema's `experiment` page template and naming convention: `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md`, with the required frontmatter (`hypothesis:`, `model:`, `commit:`, `verdict:`).
