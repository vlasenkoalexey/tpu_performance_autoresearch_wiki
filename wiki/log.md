## [2026-06-27] analyze | qwen3-jax retrospective

**Op**: analyze (retrospective).
**Pages created**: [wiki/analyses/2026-06-27-qwen3-jax-retrospective-2.md](analyses/2026-06-27-qwen3-jax-retrospective-2.md)
**Pages updated**: `wiki/index.md` (Analyses count + 1)
**Key result**: Exhaustion signal broken on jax lane (frontier pushed to 32.5% MFU from v004 via v009 scan-over-layers). Identifies FSDP collective optimization (async overlap) and Pallas kernels as the primary unblocked directions.

## [2026-06-27] loop-iteration | v009-scan-over-layers on 8B/v6e-8: confirmed (32.5% MFU)

**Op**: end
**Status**: confirmed (compiled fast; achieved ~45.3k tok/s and 32.5% MFU at 8192 seqlen with `nnx.scan` over layers and `jax.checkpoint`).
**Next hypothesis**: None right now; retrospective updated.

## [2026-06-02] run-experiment | Qwen3-8B jax (Flax NNX) v6e-8 BASELINE + cross-lane win

**Op**: run-experiment (GKE/XPK via gke-cluster-runner agent).
**Pages created**:
- [experiment: 2026-06-02-qwen3-jax-v6e8-baseline](experiments/qwen3_ag_autoresearch_optimization/jax/experiments/2026-06-02-qwen3-jax-v6e8-baseline.md)
- jax model + trainer: `jax/model/{modeling_qwen3,weight_loader,sharding,__init__}.py` (Flax NNX Qwen3 w/ QK-norm; equivalence-verified vs HF — fwd max|Δ|2.7e-7, all grads ≤8e-8), `jax/{train.py,data.py,profiling.py,upload_dir.py,Dockerfile,test_equivalence.py}`.
- hypothesis stubs: [batch-scaling](hypotheses/qwen3-jax-batch-scaling.md), [splash-attention](hypotheses/qwen3-jax-splash-attention.md), [tokamax-ce](hypotheses/qwen3-jax-tokamax-ce.md)
- profile pointer: `raw/profiles/2026-06-02-qwen3-jax-v6e8-baseline/GCS_LOCATION.txt`
**Pages updated**: [qwen3-ag-jax model page](models/qwen3-ag-jax.md) (8B/v6e-8 → live, baseline + cross-lane note + ranked hyps); [index.md](index.md) (jax model status).
**Key result**: **verdict baseline** — Qwen3-8B native-JAX (Flax NNX) on v6e-8 (fsdp=8), bs1/seq2048/bf16, synthetic: **512 ms/step, 31,955 tok/s (3,994/chip), 20.5% MFU** (xprof MXU 19.9%). **Cross-lane WIN: jax beats torchax (+7.3% tok/s/chip, +1.3 pp MFU)** at the identical shape (torchax 519 ms/3,724/19.2%). Op profile shows lower collective share (21.7% vs 31.3%) — the native-JAX path's lower dispatch/collective overhead, consistent with the llama3 torchax→jax finding. Cold compile ~2 min, `EXIT_CODE=0`. Profile (2-host) + 967 HLO modules + cache in GCS; analyzed via xprof-mcp.
**Notes**: jax image built `FROM` the torchax image (already had flax/optax/transformers) + jax code only → fast build, tiny push. Image `…/torchtitan-images/qwen3-8b-jax:latest`. Flax model split Params-only for grad (RoPE inv_freq not differentiated). Trainer smoke-validated on local v6e-4 first (16.9% MFU @ seq1024). Both lanes far below compute-bound (~20% MXU) → same headroom levers (batch, splash, CE).

## [2026-06-02] run-experiment | Qwen3-8B torchax v6e-8 BASELINE

**Op**: run-experiment (GKE/XPK via gke-cluster-runner agent).
**Pages created**:
- [experiment: 2026-06-02-qwen3-torchax-v6e8-baseline](experiments/qwen3_ag_autoresearch_optimization/torchax/experiments/2026-06-02-qwen3-torchax-v6e8-baseline.md)
- hypothesis stubs: [batch-scaling](hypotheses/qwen3-torchax-batch-scaling.md), [splash-attention](hypotheses/qwen3-torchax-splash-attention.md), [tokamax-ce](hypotheses/qwen3-torchax-tokamax-ce.md)
- profile pointer: `raw/profiles/2026-06-02-qwen3-torchax-v6e8-baseline/GCS_LOCATION.txt`
- trainer infra: `torchax/Dockerfile`, `torchax/upload_dir.py` (image build context)
**Pages updated**: [qwen3-ag-torchax model page](models/qwen3-ag-torchax.md) (variant matrix 8B/v6e-8 → live, baseline cell + ranked hyps); [index.md](index.md) (model status). Trainer `train.py` fixed: `original_inv_freq` RoPE buffer now regenerated (was zero-init).
**Key result**: **verdict baseline** — Qwen3-8B on v6e-8 (2 hosts × 4 chips, fsdp=8), bs=1/seq2048/bf16, synthetic data: **519 ms/step, 29,795 tok/s (3,724/chip), 19.2% MFU** (xprof MXU util 19.4%). **66% TC idle** — under-occupancy, not compute-bound; `convolution fusion` (matmul) only 36.9% of step. Cold compile 112.5 s, `EXIT_CODE=0`. Profile (2-host xplane) + 1274 HLO files + compile cache all in GCS at `gs://tpu-pytorch-alekseyv-us-central2/autoresearch/qwen3_ag/2026-06-02-qwen3-torchax-v6e8-baseline/`; loaded + analyzed via xprof-mcp.
**Notes**: Image `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/tpu-pytorch/torchtitan-images/qwen3-8b-torchax:latest` (digest 1ade963e), built from the adapted llama3 Dockerfile. Cluster `alekseyv-tpu-v6e8-spot-xpk` (us-central2-b) was 5/5 slices free. Baseline at seq 2048 not 8192 (minimal trainer OOMs at 8192 without splash/CE — that's the next-experiment frontier). Direct-to-GCS XLA HLO dump worked on jax-ai-image. Found + fixed a Qwen3 RoPE `original_inv_freq` zero-init bug (harmless for perf, semantics fix for real-data runs).

## [2026-06-02] manual | create-experiment — bootstrap Qwen3 8B family (torchax + jax lanes) + minimal torchax trainer

**Op**: create-experiment (new model family bootstrap).
**Pages created**:
- `wiki/experiments/qwen3_ag_autoresearch_optimization/program.md` — model-level program (architecture invariants incl. Qwen3 QK-norm, consolidated per-lane operational details, branch/profile conventions; conda env `py312`, hardware v6e-8).
- `wiki/experiments/qwen3_ag_autoresearch_optimization/torchax/` — **minimal baseline trainer**: `train.py` (meta-init + per-shard weights + FSDP mesh + plain cross-entropy + timing/MFU summary; deliberately no splash/scan/tokamax/AMP/remat knobs), `model/__init__.py`, `model/sharding.py` (Llama3-style FSDP/TP map + Qwen3 `q_norm`/`k_norm` entries), `data.py`, `helper.py`, `config.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `README.md`, `experiments/.gitkeep`.
- `wiki/experiments/qwen3_ag_autoresearch_optimization/jax/` — scaffold only (`README.md`, `experiments/.gitkeep`); lane not yet implemented.
- `wiki/models/qwen3-ag-torchax.md`, `wiki/models/qwen3-ag-jax.md` — model pages with variant matrix (8B/v6e-8 open), target metrics, iteration ladder, 4 open optimization hypotheses listed (torchax).
**Pages updated**: `wiki/index.md` (Models 2 → 4; added the two qwen3 lane rows).
**Key result**: scaffolding + a runnable minimal torchax trainer for Qwen3-8B, adapted from the llama3 torchax lane but stripped to a clean baseline. Qwen3-specific handling: QK-norm RMSNorm (`q_norm`/`k_norm`) added to the sharding plan (replicated), no QKV bias, `tie_word_embeddings=False`, `rope_theta=1e6`, 36 layers.
**Notes**: user directives — folder `qwen3_ag_autoresearch_optimization`; torchax + jax lanes, start with torchax; "minimal trainer, don't reuse everything llama3 has"; hardware **v6e-8**; conda env **py312**. TODOs left in program.md: confirm `Qwen3Config` values on-box, trunk branch name, docker image base, GCS bucket. Next: capture the 8B/v6e-8 baseline (`/start-experiment qwen3_ag torchax`), then add splash/CE/scan as attributable experiments. transformers not importable in wiki base env, so architecture table needs on-box confirmation.

## [2026-05-06] manual | AOT analysis capability — concept page, HLO-dumping expansion, SCHEMA + program template updates

**Op**: manual (schema/methodology enhancement).
**Pages created**: [`wiki/concepts/aot-compilation.md`](concepts/aot-compilation.md) — full concept page covering the JAX AOT pipeline (`jit → lower → compile → cost_analysis`), HLO pre-filter workflow, pre-experiment screening, offline HLO analysis, inline `aot_screen()` utility, known results table (Llama 3 refutations, Gemma 4 ceiling, helper.py production use), caveats.
**Pages updated**:
- [`wiki/concepts/hlo-dumping-and-diffing.md`](concepts/hlo-dumping-and-diffing.md) — expanded from 24-line stub to full concept page: dump capture commands (JAX + PyTorch/XLA), file formats and naming, stage aliases table, xprof-mcp dump tools table with usage examples, key HLO patterns to grep for, fusion verification recipe, pass-by-pass vs final-only guidance, wiki conventions.
- [`SCHEMA.md`](../SCHEMA.md) — FORMULATE-HYPOTHESIS gains step 2b (HLO pre-filter, mandatory for kernel-replacement hypotheses, requires `hlo_prefilter:` frontmatter field); RUN-EXPERIMENT gains step 1b (optional AOT screening via `cost_analysis()`); LINT gains kernel-replacement `hlo_prefilter:` check.
- [`sample-program.md`](../sample-program.md) — new `## AOT screening protocol` section with three use cases (HLO pre-filter, pre-experiment screening, offline analysis); HLO pre-filter heuristic upgraded from informal to MANDATORY with SCHEMA cross-reference; `aot-compilation` added to "Reference material at a glance".
- [`wiki/index.md`](index.md) — `aot-compilation` entry added under Compiler & HLO (12 → 13 entries, 96 → 97 concepts); `hlo-dumping-and-diffing` description updated (no longer a stub); page count 192 → 193.
**Key result**: formalizes two AOT analysis capabilities that were already in use informally: (1) HLO pre-filter for kernel-replacement hypotheses (now mandatory in SCHEMA), (2) pre-experiment AOT screening (now documented as optional step). Also documents offline HLO analysis for customer-sends-dumps workflow. No new SCHEMA operations added — AOT folds into existing FORMULATE-HYPOTHESIS and RUN-EXPERIMENT operations.
**Notes**: design decision: AOT analysis does NOT become a new operation. It integrates into existing operations where the analysis naturally occurs (hypothesis pre-filtering, pre-experiment screening, offline analysis under ANALYZE). The xprof-mcp dump tools already work on CPU without TPU; the JAX AOT pattern already exists in `helper.py`. What was missing was formalization in the schema, concept documentation, and program template.

## [2026-04-30] manual | sample-program.md — root-level template extracted from Llama 3 + Gemma 4 program.md files

**Op**: manual (template extraction).
**Pages created**: [`sample-program.md`](../sample-program.md) (project root, ~250 lines).
**Pages updated**: [`README.md`](../README.md) — Get-started step 4 now points users at `sample-program.md` instead of asking the agent to derive a program.md from scratch; repo-layout block lists the new file.
**Key result**: the two existing program.md files (Llama 3 8B, Gemma 4 E4B) are ~95 % identical — only the model identity, architecture table, conda env name, branch prefix, libtpu version, and per-model Pallas tables differ. The template separates `<!-- GENERIC -->` sections (contract, what-you-can-cannot-do, the loop, branch model, measurement protocol, output format, observations template, heuristics, references — copy-paste verbatim) from `<!-- MODEL-SPECIFIC -->` sections (the binding values + the two Pallas-kernel tables). Includes a "How to use this template" intro block and an inline reference to the worked Llama 3 / Gemma 4 instantiations as cross-reference.
**Notes**: incorporates the schema changes from this morning — references the now-required `## Next hypotheses` (SCHEMA.md), the bottleneck reverse-index analysis, the HLO pre-filter heuristic, and the Pallas kernel directory. 41 markdown links validated, all resolve.

## [2026-04-30] analyze | Bottleneck reverse-index v0 — profile bucket → candidate levers + tried-and-refuted

**Op**: analyze (bootstrap a standing reverse-index page).
**Pages created**: [analyses/2026-04-30-bottleneck-reverse-index.md](analyses/2026-04-30-bottleneck-reverse-index.md).
**Pages updated**: [index.md](index.md) (Analyses 5 → 6, with featured-quality blurb so the agent reads it before formulating hypotheses).
**Key result**: covers 7 measured buckets (matmul, splash MHA, CE, loop-fusion, collectives, HBM peak, data-formatting) plus 4 placeholder buckets for regimes not yet seen in this wiki (megascale/DCN, embedding-grad, host overhead, VMEM spill). Each bucket section has Standing levers + Tried & refuted + Open hypotheses subsections; cross-links to the concept directory, the kernel directory, and the experiment ledger. Bootstrap data source is the [llama3-8b-torchax converged-stack bottleneck breakdown](observations/llama3-8b-torchax-converged-stack-bottleneck-breakdown.md) observation (exp 61b + exp 79 traces).
**Notes**: explicitly framed as **non-exhaustive and not a fence** — the front-matter callout says treat absence-from-this-list as "haven't tried it here yet," not "won't work." Pairs with [SCHEMA](../SCHEMA.md) `## Next hypotheses` requirement (logged below) — this page is the primary upstream consumer for that section. Future automation note recorded: when concept + hypothesis frontmatter gain a `bottleneck_bucket:` field, the page can be regenerated as a LINT subtask. Not wired up yet.

## [2026-04-30] manual | SCHEMA — `## Next hypotheses` made mandatory + structured in experiment pages; LINT extended

**Op**: manual (schema edit).
**Pages updated**: [SCHEMA.md](../SCHEMA.md) — experiment template (Next hypotheses now bolded as required, with explicit format rules: bullets link to existing `hypotheses/<slug>.md` pages, `None — <reason>` allowed, empty/absent fails LINT); RUN-EXPERIMENT op gains step 8 ("File next-hypothesis stubs") so every bullet resolves to a real page filed concurrently with the experiment, `origin: <experiment-slug>`; LINT gains two checks (missing/empty Next hypotheses, dangling `origin:` references).
**Key result**: closes the gap where follow-ups were captured in prose and forgotten. The discipline is "breadth at capture time" — three+ bullets is normal; ranking happens later. Existing experiments are not retrofitted (immutability rule); new experiments from 2026-04-30 onward must comply.
**Notes**: implements proposal #5 from the 2026-04-30 hypothesis-generation review. Proposal #1 (HLO pre-filter as required step for kernel-replacement hypotheses) and #2 (`DIFF-REFERENCE` op) remain unimplemented.

## [2026-04-27] HLO inspection | jax Llama 3 8B v6e-8 — hypotheses #2 and #3 (Pallas RMSNorm+matmul, Pallas SwiGLU+down_proj) refuted by HLO before kernel-write; XLA already does both fusions

**Op**: HLO dump + inspection (one short run with `XLA_FLAGS="--xla_dump_to=/tmp/hlo --xla_dump_hlo_as_text"`) + analysis via `mcp__xprof__list_hlo_dump_modules` and grep over `module_0262.jit_train_step.cl_854318611.after_optimizations.hlo`.
**Pages updated**: `wiki/hypotheses/llama3-jax-rmsnorm-matmul-prologue-fusion.md` (status: refuted); `wiki/hypotheses/llama3-jax-pallas-swiglu-downproj-fusion.md` (status: refuted); `wiki/index.md` (open hypotheses 3 → 1); `.gitignore` (exception added for `*-hlodump-*/`).
**Pages created**: `raw/profiles/2026-04-27-jax-hlodump-exp28b/{module_0262, module_0449}.jit_train_step.cl_854318611.after_optimizations.hlo` (~870 KB each, evidence preserved).
**Key result**:
- **Hypothesis #2 (Pallas RMSNorm + matmul-prologue fusion) — REFUTED**. The Q-proj fusion `%fusion.316 = … kind=kOutput, calls=%fused_computation.47` inlines `%fusion.301 = calls=%fused_computation.25` (which is the entire RMSNorm body: bf16→f32 cast, broadcast rsqrt scale, multiply, broadcast RMSNorm weight, multiply, f32→bf16 cast, bitcast). Then `%convolution.107` matmuls the RMSNorm output against the Q-projection weight, all within a single `kind=kOutput` Mosaic kernel. Same pattern repeats for K-proj (`fused_computation.48`), gate/up MLP projections (`fused_computation.31/.32`).
- **Hypothesis #3 (Pallas SwiGLU + down_proj fusion) — REFUTED**. The down-proj fusion `%fusion.323 = … kind=kOutput, calls=%fused_computation.40` contains: `%fusion.311 = calls=%fused_computation.8` (the full `silu(g)*u` body — negate, exp, add, divide, multiply for silu, then multiply with `u`), the `%convolution.111` down-proj matmul reading `fusion.311`'s output, and the `%add.856` residual add. **One single Mosaic `kind=kOutput` kernel** that covers exactly the work hypothesis #3 proposed to write.

**Implication**: The 9.2 % loop-fusion line in [exp 28b's profile](experiments/llama3_8B_autoresearch_optimization/jax/experiments/2026-04-26-jax-exp27-28-sparsecore-rs-ag-offload-frontier.md#profile) is NOT coming from RMSNorm-to-matmul or SwiGLU-to-down_proj round-trips — XLA already consumes those in their respective `kind=kOutput` matmul fusions. The remaining loop-fusion bytes (1,547 GiB/step) come from elsewhere: residual scratchpads, embedding gradient, FSDP all-gather staging, fp32-master-weight casts. None of those are obvious Pallas-kernel targets.

**Open hypotheses count: 3 → 1**. Only int8/AQT (#1, +15-30 % expected, biggest single lever) remains as a meaningful per-chip throughput lever.

**Win for the autoresearch methodology**: a 30-minute HLO-inspection + my own filed Risks section in hypothesis #3 ("pallas-forge TPU SwiGLU loses 35 % to XLA on v5e — validate via HLO before kernel write") saved weeks of kernel-writing effort by refuting both hypotheses cheaply, before committing to a Pallas project.

## [2026-04-27] run-experiment | jax Llama 3 8B v6e-8 — 100-step loss-curve validation: optimization stack is bit-equivalent to baseline (max |Δ| = 0.0003)

**Op**: run-experiment (× 5: jax-exp 65/66/67/68/69 — 100-step loss validation across 3 stack configurations + 2 LR-matched MaxText comparisons).
**Pages created**: `wiki/experiments/.../jax/experiments/2026-04-27-jax-exp65-67-loss-validation-100steps.md`. Raw 100-step loss trajectories preserved at `raw/profiles/2026-04-27-jax-exp65-67-loss-validation/exp{65..69}.txt` (gitignore exception added for `*-loss-validation/`).
**Pages updated**: `wiki/experiments/.../jax/data.py` reading + script changes (`exp_jax_maxtext_flags.sh` adds `USE_REAL_DATA` / `LR` env-var pass-through; new `exp_jax_minimal.sh` for the minimal-flags baseline) — code changes already shipped in image `precast-1`.
**Key result**: **All three optimization layers (MaxText XLA stack + SC offload, tokamax-splash kernel choice, tokamax-splash perf knobs) are loss-clean over 100 training steps to within bf16 precision floor.** Three independent 100-step runs at identical RNG seed:
- exp 65 (full optimized stack at 7,601 tok/s/chip 42.6 % MFU)
- exp 66 (minimal-flags + jax-experimental splash at 6,336 tok/s/chip 35.5 % MFU)
- exp 67 (minimal-flags + tokamax-splash defaults at 6,509 tok/s/chip 36.5 % MFU)

Aggregate stats over 100 steps:
- exp 65 vs exp 66 (full opt vs jax-experimental ref): max\|Δ\| = 0.0003, median Δ = +0.0000, 86/100 steps within 0.0001
- exp 65 vs exp 67 (perf-knobs ON vs OFF): max\|Δ\| = 0.0003
- exp 67 vs exp 66 (kernel impl difference): max\|Δ\| = 0.0002

Loss values are around 11.9 (synthetic random data), bf16 precision floor ≈ 0.09 absolute. **All observed deltas are 300× below the bf16 noise floor** — equivalent to pure XLA scheduling-order rounding noise.

**Throughput-with-equivalent-loss**: optimization stack delivers **+19.9 % per-chip throughput** over the most-pristine baseline with **zero measurable loss-curve drift**.

**MaxText comparison flagged**: MaxText baseline's reported synthetic-data loss collapse (12.26 → 1.79 over 19 steps) does not match our 11.93 → 11.81 over 100 steps even at matched lr=3e-5 (exp 68/69). Root cause: our `data.py:fake_dataloader` draws fresh random tokens every batch (model cannot memorize), MaxText's synthetic dataset re-uses fixed sequences (rapid memorization). Data-pipeline difference, not numerics. Both stacks compute identical forward+backward on the data they see.

**Notes**: Initial 100-step attempts on real wikitext-2 data terminated at step 9 ("data exhausted"); switched to synthetic for the validation. Synthetic random data also more rigorous for numerics — tightest possible bf16-noise comparison.

## [2026-04-27] formulate + run-experiment | jax Llama 3 8B v6e-8 — 22-experiment exhaustive ablation around exp 28b; frontier saturated at ~7,700/chip 43.3 % MFU

**Op**: formulate (3 deep-work hypotheses) + run-experiment (× 22: jax-exp 39-60 ablation around the SparseCore-offload frontier).
**Pages created**:
- `wiki/hypotheses/llama3-jax-rmsnorm-matmul-prologue-fusion.md`
- `wiki/hypotheses/llama3-jax-pallas-swiglu-downproj-fusion.md`
- `wiki/hypotheses/llama3-jax-int8-weight-quantization.md`
**Pages updated**: `wiki/experiments/.../jax/experiments/2026-04-26-jax-exp27-28-sparsecore-rs-ag-offload-frontier.md` (added Wave 4-5 ablation table + noise-band correction); image `precast-1` shipped with the bf16 pre-cast env-var knob.
**Key result**: **No further knob improves on exp 28b.** Three independent re-runs measure the noise band as **±0.7 %** (±50 tok/s/chip); the honest frontier is **~7,700 tok/s/chip / 43.3 % MFU** (mean), not the 7,768/43.6 % single-run peak. vs MaxText 7,069/chip = **+8.9 % per chip** (mean), still beating their reference.
**Ablation summary (22 runs in five waves, all refuted or within noise)**:
- Remat policies: `save_out_proj` OOM at bs=4 / -0.6 % at bs=3; `save_qkv_proj` OOM bs=4; `qkv_proj_offloaded` -0.8 to -0.9 % at bs=4-5.
- Kernel/density: scan unroll=2 -1.9 %; SPLASH_BQ=4096 -21 %; SPLASH_BKV=512 -2.2 %; SPLASH_BKV_DKV=1024 -3.3 %; bs=3 -2.7 % vs bs=4 frontier.
- VMEM: 65,536 -4.2 %; 81,920 -1.6 %; 131,072 -2.9 % (all worse than 98,304).
- XLA flags (added or flipped): disable_bundle_aware_cost_model -1.7 %; enhanced_launch_barrier -1.1 %; async_collective_permute within noise; megacore_fusion_allow_ags=false within noise; combo of the two within-noise -1.1 %; collective matmul ENABLED -14.7 % (hard refute); overlap_compute_collective_tc=false -1.1 %; aggressive_opt_barrier_removal=DISABLED within noise; latency_hiding_scheduler_rerun=0 within noise; loop-invariant chain DISABLED -0.7 %; tokamax CE = mosaic_tpu -4.4 %.
- Code change: pre-cast bf16 weights once per train_step → -0.5 to -1.1 % (XLA already fuses cast into matmul prologue; pre-cast adds an HBM round-trip rather than removing one).
**Deep-work hypotheses filed**: (1) Pallas RMSNorm + matmul-prologue fusion (expected +3-6 %, effort L); (2) Pallas SwiGLU + down_proj fusion (expected +2-4 %, effort L; **but pallas-forge's TPU SwiGLU loses 35 % to XLA on v5e — XLA may already be doing this fusion. Validate with HLO dump first.**); (3) int8 / AQT or qwix weight-only quantization (expected +15-30 %, effort L). All three include a SwiGLU-research-agent finding: best scaffolding is `tpu-inference/tpu_inference/kernels/fused_moe/v1/kernel.py:77-85,1476-1482` which already fuses `silu(gate)*up` with two grouped matmuls in a single TPU Pallas kernel.
**Verdict**: bf16-MXU optimization regime is saturated. Further wins require either custom Pallas kernels (eat the 9.2 % loop-fusion line) or int8 quantization (break the 65.8 % bf16-MXU ceiling).

## [2026-04-26] run-experiment | jax Llama 3 8B v6e-8 — exp 29-38 post-frontier knob sweep; exp 28b holds

**Op**: run-experiment (× 8: jax-exp 29-38 follow-ups to the SparseCore-offload frontier).
**Pages updated**: `wiki/experiments/.../jax/experiments/2026-04-26-jax-exp27-28-sparsecore-rs-ag-offload-frontier.md` (extended Follow-up sweeps table); `wiki/experiments/.../jax/{train.py, model/modeling_llama3.py}` (named-checkpoint markers + `_resolve_scan_policy` helper); built docker image tag `saveqkv-1` carrying the new code.
**Key result**: **All seven post-frontier knobs refuted.** exp 28b (7,768/chip 43.6 % MFU at bs=4 + bkv=1024 + full SC offload) holds as the durable frontier. The TC is now 99.986 % busy and recomputation during bwd is "free" because TC has slack while collectives are SC-offloaded — so any policy that saves activations to HBM (`save_qkv_proj`) blows compile peak, and any policy that saves to host (`qkv_proj_offloaded`) costs more PCIe traffic than it saves in avoided matmul recompute.
**Refutations summary**:
- exp 29: VMEM=131072 (vs 98304) → 7,546/chip 42.3 % (-2.9 %); same direction as torchax exp 77.
- exp 30: bkv=2048 (vs 1024) → 7,752/chip 43.5 % (-0.2 % within noise); the +0.7 % bkv-2048 lift from exp 18 does **not** compound once SC offload is on.
- exp 31: bs=3 (MaxText shape) → 7,559/chip 42.4 %; density check confirms we still beat MaxText 7,069/chip by **+6.9 %** at their exact shape.
- exp 32: SPLASH_BQ=4096 → 6,122/chip 34.3 % (**-21.2 %**); VMEM spill from larger query blocks.
- exp 35: `save_qkv_proj` (named QKV save) → OOM at compile by +5.67 GiB at bs=4; saving Q/K/V across 32 scanned layers exceeds HBM peak.
- exp 36: `qkv_proj_offloaded` bs=4 → 7,641/chip 42.8 % (-1.6 %); host PCIe latency > recompute savings.
- exp 37: `qkv_proj_offloaded` bs=6 → runtime OOM; host offload doesn't shrink the runtime workspace floor.
- exp 38: `qkv_proj_offloaded` bs=5 → 7,634/chip 42.8 % (-1.7 %); same conclusion at higher density.
**Code change shipped** (image tag `saveqkv-1`): `jax.ad_checkpoint.checkpoint_name` markers around all seven projections (query/key/value/out/mlpwi_0/mlpwi_1/mlpwo) in `_decoder_call`, plus a `_resolve_scan_policy` helper that recognises MaxText's policy names (`save_qkv_proj`, `save_out_proj`, `save_dot_except_mlp`, `qkv_proj_offloaded`, `minimal_offloaded`). These knobs are now available for future work without further code changes.
**Notes**: One docker tag-cache hiccup (kubelet cached an old `jax-v6` digest with the same content as the prior `jax-v5`; resolved by pushing under a fresh tag `saveqkv-1`).

## [2026-04-26] run-experiment | jax Llama 3 8B v6e-8 — exp 27/28b SparseCore RS+AG offload + bs=4 → NEW FRONTIER 7,768/chip 43.6 % MFU

**Op**: run-experiment (jax-exp 26 profile + jax-exp 27 bs=5 + jax-exp 28 bs=6 + jax-exp 28b bs=4 + jax-exp 28pf profile rerun).
**Pages created**: [`wiki/experiments/.../jax/experiments/2026-04-26-jax-exp27-28-sparsecore-rs-ag-offload-frontier.md`](experiments/llama3_8B_autoresearch_optimization/jax/experiments/2026-04-26-jax-exp27-28-sparsecore-rs-ag-offload-frontier.md).
**Pages updated**: `wiki/index.md` (Models entry, Experiments list, headline count); `wiki/experiments/.../jax/experiments/README.md` (Current best table now points to exp 28b).
**Key result**: **NEW PROGRAM-TARGET BEST 7,768 tok/s/chip, 43.6 % MFU at bs=4 seq=8192** — beats prior frontier (exp 18 at 7,471/chip 41.9 %) by **+4.0 % per chip**, beats MaxText reference (7,069/chip 44.6 %) by **+9.9 % per chip**. Reported MFU gap to MaxText narrowed from 2.7 pp → 1.0 pp.
**The lever**: exp 26 profile of bs=5 frontier showed `async-all-reduce-scatter` at **5.0 % of step time** still on the TensorCore. Adding `xla_tpu_enable_sparse_core_collective_offload_{reduce_scatter,all_gather}=true` (matching MaxText's full SC offload triplet — we previously had only the all-reduce variant) relays both remaining FSDP collectives onto the SparseCore. **+3.4 % per chip at bs=5** (exp 27: 7,724/chip 43.3 %); **+0.6 % more at bs=4** density (exp 28b: 7,768/chip 43.6 %). bs=6 OOMs by ~220 MiB — bkv=2048 splash floor raises memory pressure beyond what density alone can compensate.
**Loss**: identical step-for-step to prior frontiers (11.90 → 10.10 across 9 steps at bs=4) — no semantic regression.
**Cumulative day climb**: torchax exp 20 4,591 → jax exp 28b 7,768 = **+69.2 % per-chip**.
**Notes**: User's standing directive ("keep working on it until you match or exceed maxtext performance, do not stop") was already satisfied at exp 13 (+3.9 %); we have continued pushing through three further frontier advances (exp 18 → exp 27 → exp 28b). Profile capture rerun (exp 28pf) submitted with full SC offload + sleep-hold for trace retrieval.

## [2026-04-26] run-experiment + profile | torchax Llama 3 8B v6e-8 — exp 75-81 final sweep at the exp 74b frontier; converged

**Op**: run-experiment (× 11: exp 75-81 follow-ups) + profile capture (exp 79) + observation update.
**Pages updated**: `wiki/experiments/.../2026-04-26-exp72a-tokamax-splash-bs3-seq8k-accepted.md` (extended §"Refuted" with all post-acceptance refutations); `wiki/observations/llama3-8b-torchax-converged-stack-bottleneck-breakdown.md` (added §"Updated breakdown 2026-04-26 latest frontier").
**Profile artifact**: `gs://<your-bucket>/jax-experiment/llama3-8b-exp79-tk-prof/` (kubectl-cp'd from pod `/tmp` then uploaded — the gcsfuse-mount /data/* paths return 403 on profile writes from inside the pod, so the workaround is: write profile to /tmp, post-run `tar czf` + `sleep 600` to keep pod alive, then `kubectl cp` from outside).
**Key result**: Frontier holds at exp 74b — **6,559 tok/s/chip, 36.8 % MFU at bs=3 seq=8192**. Every post-acceptance knob refuted or invalid.
**Refutations summary (all 2026-04-26)**:
- exp 75a: `cost_estimate_flops_fwd/bwd` — neutral; XLA already overlaps without hints.
- exp 76a/b: `q_seq_shards=2`/`q_seq_shards=4` — **INVALID** (NaN loss from step 1; q_seq_shards needs a context-parallel mesh axis we don't have).
- exp 77a/b: VMEM=131,072 / 65,536 KiB — both -2.7 % / -3.1 %; VMEM=98 KiB still optimal.
- exp 78a/b: `scan_remat_policy=dots_with_no_batch_dims_saveable` / `dots_saveable` — both OOM (matmul-output saves don't fit even at bs=2).
- exp 80a/b/c: splash block-size variants (bkv=512, bq=1024, symmetric 2048/2048) — all -0.1 to -0.4 %; current splash 2048/1024/2048/2048 fused config still optimal.
- exp 81a/b: `JAX_DEFAULT_MATMUL_PRECISION=bfloat16`/`tensorfloat32` — within noise / -0.5 %; `default` already does bf16 on TPU efficiently.
**Profile breakdown at frontier** (single-host trace, exp 79):
- Conv fusion (matmul): **54.4 %** of step time, HBM-BW util 0.54, **73.9 % MXU efficiency when running**
- Splash MHA fwd+dkv: 21.8 %
- Loop fusion (RMSNorm/silu/residual): 15.2 %, HBM-BW util 0.75 (saturated)
- Tokamax CE: ~0 % (collapsed from 7.5 % via chunked_xla)
- MXU utilization 55.0 % (was 51.9 % at exp 61b)
**Cumulative day climb**: 4,591 → 6,559 tok/s/chip = **+42.9 % per-chip**. Gap to MaxText 44.6 % reference: 7.8 pp. Closing this gap would require a **custom Pallas matmul prologue** that fuses the bf16 weight materialization into the matmul (skip the HBM round-trip) and/or **MaxText-style layer fusion** patterns. Those are deep-work levers not reachable by knob-sweeping the existing call sites.

## [2026-04-26] run-experiment | torchax Llama 3 8B v6e-8 — exp 74b tokamax-splash + max_logit_const advances frontier to 36.8 % MFU bs=3 seq=8192

**Op**: run-experiment (× 7: exp 74a-f mlc sweep; exp 75a cost_estimate; exp 76a/b q_seq_shards INVALID).
**Pages updated**: `wiki/experiments/.../2026-04-26-exp72a-tokamax-splash-bs3-seq8k-accepted.md` (added §"Follow-up: + max_logit_const" + §"Refuted post-acceptance" + §"Final (valid) frontier"); `wiki/index.md` (program-target best advanced to 6,559/chip 36.8 %; cumulative climb 42.9 %).
**Docker images**: hf-v36 (max_logit_const knob) → hf-v37 (cost_estimate knobs) → hf-v38 (q_seq_shards env knob).
**Key result**: **🏆 exp 74b: tokamax-splash + base2 + fuse_recip + max_logit_const=30 @ bs=3 seq=8192 = 52,475 TPS (6,559/chip), 36.8 % MFU** — **+2.6 % per-chip** over exp 72a (6,392 / 35.8 %). Cumulative day climb: 4,591 → 6,559 = **+42.9 %**. Gap to MaxText: 7.8 pp.
**Notes**:
- mlc value insensitive (10 / 20 / 30 / 50 all within ±0.1 %); the win is just turning the optimization path on. Llama attention logits stay well below 10 in practice (post-`/sqrt(d_head)` scaling), so the kernel never clamps. Loss values **identical step-for-step** to exp 72a — the kernel skips a redundant softmax stabilization pass when the cap is provided. MaxText's `use_max_logit_estimate` defaults to `-1` (off) — they don't enable this for Llama either, so we found a knob they haven't enabled by default.
- `cost_estimate_flops_fwd/bwd` (exp 75a): neutral. XLA already overlaps the splash kernel with FSDP collectives without the hint.
- **INVALIDATED: exp 76a/b** (`q_seq_shards=2`/`q_seq_shards=4`): NaN loss from step 1 onward. q_seq_shards is meant for sequence sharding across a context-parallel mesh axis; we have no such axis. The throughput "win" (+10 %) is an artifact of NaN values short-circuiting downstream ops. Rejected.

## [2026-04-26] run-experiment | torchax Llama 3 8B v6e-8 — exp 72a tokamax-shipped splash NEW PROGRAM-TARGET BEST 35.8 % MFU bs=3 seq=8192

**Op**: run-experiment (× 7: exp 71a/b — broken mask API; exp 72a-d valid sweep; exp 73a-c ablations).
**Pages created**: `wiki/experiments/.../2026-04-26-exp72a-tokamax-splash-bs3-seq8k-accepted.md`.
**Pages updated**: `wiki/index.md` (program-target best advanced; experiment count 16 → 17).
**Docker images**: hf-v33 → hf-v34 (fix tokamax mask API: single mask, not MultiHeadMask) → hf-v35 (add `dq_reduction_steps` env knob).
**Key result**: **🏆 exp 72a: tokamax-shipped splash attention with `use_base2_exp=True` + `fuse_reciprocal=True` @ bs=3 seq=8192 = 51,139 TPS (6,392/chip), 35.8 % MFU** — **+1.3 % per-chip** over the prior exp 65 frontier (jax-splash, 6,313/chip 35.4 %). Holds at +1.8 % at bs=2 and +1.2 % at bs=4. Cumulative day climb: 4,591 → 6,392 = **+39.2 % per-chip** vs morning AMP-only baseline (exp 20). Gap to MaxText 44.6 %: now 8.8 pp (was 9.2 pp).
**Notes**:
- Discovered by reading MaxText's `src/maxtext/layers/attention_op.py` at the `use_tokamax_splash` branch — they expose tokamax's own splash impl alongside upstream JAX's, with extra perf knobs (`use_base2_exp`, `fuse_reciprocal`, `use_experimental_scheduler`, `dq_reduction_steps`, `max_logit_const`). The first two compound super-additively.
- **Ablations (exp 73a-c)**: `base2=T fuse_recip=F` = +0.7 %; `base2=F fuse_recip=T` = +0.8 %; both = +1.3 %. `use_experimental_scheduler=T` = -0.2 % (worse); `dq_reduction_steps=3` = +0.5 % (also worse than defaults). Optimal config = `base2=T + fuse_recip=T` only.
- **Mechanism**: `use_base2_exp` swaps `exp(x)` for `exp2(x / ln 2)` — TPU's `exp2` is faster, the rescale fuses with the upstream multiply, mathematically identical. `fuse_reciprocal` moves the `output / lse` division inside the kernel so we save one HBM round-trip on the post-attention output buffer per layer.
- **API note**: tokamax splash takes a single `mask` (broadcasts to heads internally), not `MultiHeadMask`. Trip-up cost one rebuild (hf-v33 → hf-v34).

## [2026-04-26] run-experiment + INVALIDATION | torchax Llama 3 8B v6e-8 — splash sweep (refuted) + exp 66 series invalidated; valid frontier reverts to exp 65 at 35.4 % MFU

**Op**: run-experiment (× 8: exp 67a-d splash sweep on broken stack; exp 68a-d splash sweep on valid stack) + invalidation entry.
**Pages updated**: `wiki/experiments/llama3_8B_autoresearch_optimization/torchax/experiments/2026-04-26-exp62b-chunkedxla-ce-bs3-seq8k-accepted.md` (added invalidation note for exp 66 series; appended exp 67/68 sweep table); `wiki/index.md` (program-target best reverted to exp 65 with explanatory note); `wiki/log.md` (this entry).
**Docker images**: hf-v31 (splash env-var config; built on top of broken hf-v30), hf-v32 (reinstates fp32 cast for chunked_xla; correct stack).
**Key result**: **🏆 valid PROGRAM-TARGET BEST = exp 65: 50,502 TPS (6,313/chip), 35.4 % MFU at bs=3 seq=8192**. Cumulative day climb: 4,591 → 6,313 = +37.5 % per-chip vs morning AMP-only baseline (exp 20).
**Notes**:
- **Invalidation: exp 66 / 66b / 66c / 66d** (bf16-native chunked_xla — skipped the `astype(jnp.float32)` cast on the theory that chunked_xla returns grads in input dtype natively). Threw away ~+0.3 % per-chip as wins for ~30 minutes. Found wrong: chunked_xla kernel sets `dtype = x.dtype` and uses that for lse / loss_sum **accumulators** ([chunked_xla.py lines 88, 119, 127, 136, 137, 156](trainer/tokamax_lib/.../linear_softmax_cross_entropy_loss/chunked_xla.py)). With bf16 input, the inner-loop accumulators are bf16 — at magnitude ~11 (cross-entropy initial) bf16 quantum is ~0.04, accumulating across 64 V-blocks compounds. Loss output empirically plateaued at multiples of 0.0625 (`loss=11.1250 → 11.0000`) vs exp 65's clean monotone decay (`11.7681 → 11.6403` over 12 steps). Per project rule "no model-quality optimizations", invalid. Reverted in hf-v32.
- **Splash sweep (exp 68 series)** on the valid stack confirms current config (bq=2048 bkv=1024 bq_dkv=2048 bkv_dkv=2048 fused) is optimal: bq=4096 -2.8 %, symmetric 4096/4096 -5.2 %, unfused bwd -4.5 %. The exp 8/9/10 spring autotune universal winner still holds.
- Splash dkv bwd remains the biggest custom-call cost (10.7 % of step time per the [bottleneck observation](wiki/observations/llama3-8b-torchax-converged-stack-bottleneck-breakdown.md)). Remaining lever points: pull MaxText's attention bwd kernel (deep work); custom V-sharded CE that avoids the lm_head all-gather (custom kernel work); not many easy local wins left.

## [2026-04-26] run-experiment | torchax Llama 3 8B v6e-8 — exp 65 → 66b refinement, FRONTIER ADVANCED to 35.5 % MFU bs=3 seq=8192

**Op**: run-experiment (× 6: exp 64–66d).
**Pages updated**: `wiki/experiments/.../2026-04-26-exp62b-chunkedxla-ce-bs3-seq8k-accepted.md` (added §"Follow-ups" with 7-row table); `wiki/index.md` (program-target best advanced; experiment count entry updated to read exp 62b → 66b path).
**Docker images**: hf-v29 (chunked_xla without shard_map — refuted) → hf-v30 (chunked_xla bf16 native, no fp32 cast, shard_map kept).
**Key result**: **🏆 exp 66b: chunked_xla + bf16 native + autotune @ bs=3 seq=8192 = 50,647 TPS (6,331/chip), 35.5 % MFU** — +0.4 % over exp 62b, +2.1 % per-chip over the prior mosaic_tpu+autotune frontier (exp 56), and **+37.8 % per-chip over the morning AMP-only baseline (exp 20)**.
**Notes**:
- exp 64/64b (chunked_xla *without* shard_map): -36 % per-chip; JAX auto-partition picks a far worse pattern. shard_map remains essential even for the XLA-only impl. Refuted.
- exp 65 (autotune): +0.16 % over exp 62b. Autotune marginal but positive on chunked_xla's b/v block sizes.
- exp 66 / 66b: skipping the fp32 input cast (the cast was only added to handle mosaic_tpu's hardcoded fp32 grad output — chunked_xla returns grads in input dtype natively) yields +0.3 %. Free win once the analysis was done.
- Final stack: `--weights_dtype=fp32 --compute_dtype=bf16 --master_dtype=fp32 --use_splash=True --use_scan=True --use_tokamax_ce=True --tokamax_ce_impl=chunked_xla --tokamax_ce_autotune=True --batch_size=3 --seqlen=8192` plus the bf16-native-cast guard inside the trainer (set when `tokamax_ce_impl=="chunked_xla"`).
- Profile capture for chunked_xla still pending — both attempts (exp 63, exp 62) hit GCS HTTP 403 mid-run on profile-write to `gs://<your-bucket>/{autoresearch,cache}/profiles/`. The pod's workload identity has read but not write IAM on those prefixes. TODO: either grant the role, or use a different bucket prefix (XLA cache writes to `gs://.../cache/xla/` succeed, so the bucket is OK — only the `/profiles/` subpath is wrong).

## [2026-04-26] run-experiment | torchax Llama 3 8B v6e-8 — exp 62b chunked_xla CE NEW PROGRAM-TARGET BEST 35.3 % MFU bs=3 seq=8192

**Op**: run-experiment (× 5: exp 62 + 62b/c/d/e). Triggered directly by the xprof bottleneck observation.
**Pages created**: `wiki/experiments/llama3_8B_autoresearch_optimization/torchax/experiments/2026-04-26-exp62b-chunkedxla-ce-bs3-seq8k-accepted.md`.
**Pages updated**: `wiki/index.md` (program-target best advanced; experiment count 15 → 16).
**Docker images**: hf-v28 — adds `--tokamax_ce_impl` flag (default `mosaic_tpu`, new option `chunked_xla`).
**Key result**: **🏆 exp 62b: chunked_xla CE @ bs=3 seq=8192 = 50,424 TPS (6,303/chip), 35.3 % MFU**. +1.6 % per-chip over the prior exp 56 frontier (6,202 / 34.8 %). The same swap also lifts bs=2 to 6,214/chip 34.8 % (+2.7 %) and bs=4 to 6,161/chip 34.5 % (+2.8 %). bs=5 OOMs by 2.91 GiB — bs=4 remains the density ceiling.
**Notes**:
- The xprof breakdown predicted this win: tokamax CE bwd was 263 ms (6.6 %) at 21 % MXU efficiency, asymmetrically expensive vs the 36 ms fwd. The `chunked_xla` impl uses standard XLA matmuls and avoids the Pallas-recompute path. End-to-end gain landed at +1.6 % at the program-target shape; expected, validated, accepted.
- `chunked_xla` keeps one `(B*L, V_chunk)` slice in HBM during fwd+bwd. Fits within bs=3 envelope at seq=8192; bs=5 doesn't fit (FFN intermediate hits ceiling, unrelated to CE impl).
- Profile-write to GCS in exp 62 hit a 403 mid-run (HTTP permission). Exp 62b/c/d/e ran without profile capture and were clean. Profile bring-up TODO: get the right IAM role for the pod's workload identity to write to `gs://<your-bucket>/autoresearch/profiles/`.

## [2026-04-26] xprof-bottleneck-breakdown | torchax Llama 3 8B v6e-8 — converged-stack profile breakdown

**Op**: record-observation (xprof).
**Pages created**: `wiki/observations/llama3-8b-torchax-converged-stack-bottleneck-breakdown.md`.
**Profile**: `gs://<your-bucket>/autoresearch/profiles/llama3-8b-exp61b-profile-bs3/` (captured by exp 61b, a 9-step short run with profile_step=5; the autotune kernel selection is identical to exp 56's frontier, so this trace is representative of the program-target stack).
**Key result**: per-chip per-step time at the converged stack = **3,964 ms total**; matmul (conv fusion) **46.0 %**, splash MHA fwd+dkv bwd **24.4 %**, tokamax CE fwd+bwd **7.5 %**, loop fusion (RMSNorm/silu/etc.) **13.6 %**, data formatting 3.6 %, misc 5 %. **MXU util 51.9 %, MFU 34.8 %** — gap to MaxText 44.6 % is non-matmul time + matmul-tile-utilization headroom inside conv fusion (HBM-BW util 0.54 there).
**Notes**:
- Tokamax CE bwd is asymmetrically expensive (263 ms ≈ 7 × the 36 ms fwd) — the mosaic-TPU bwd recomputes logit blocks; only ~21 % MXU-efficient by back-of-envelope FLOPs accounting. Worth testing `implementation="chunked_xla"` next.
- Splash dkv bwd (423 ms = 10.7 %) is the single biggest custom-call cost; pulling in MaxText's attention bwd kernel for comparison is the deepest leverage point.
- Loop fusion (RMSNorm + silu + residual + mul) already at 0.77 HBM-BW util — saturated; no throughput to recover at that layer.

## [2026-04-26] run-experiment-batch-program-target | torchax Llama 3 8B v6e-8 — exp 51 → 55b (tokamax CE + fp32 master, NEW PROGRAM-TARGET BEST 34.6 % MFU bs=3 seq=8192)

**Op**: run-experiment (× many: exp 48 → exp 56) + tokamax-CE bring-up (5 image revs) + true-AMP-master implementation + MFU-formula bug fix.
**Pages created**: `wiki/experiments/llama3_8B_autoresearch_optimization/torchax/experiments/2026-04-26-exp55b-fp32-master-tokamax-ce-bs3-seq8k-accepted.md` (this milestone).
**Pages updated**: `wiki/index.md` (program-target status updated; experiment count 13 → 14).
**Docker images**: hf-v18 → hf-v26 (each rev fixes one bring-up issue: skip_lm_head, absl-flags pre-mark, fp32 cast at boundary, shard_map wrap, compute_dtype, MFU divisor).
**Key result**: **🏆 exp 55b: bs=3 seq=8192 with scan + splash + tokamax CE (shard_map'd) + fp32 master + bf16 compute = 49,427 TPS (6,178/chip), 34.6 % MFU.** +35 % per-chip TPS over exp 20 (prior program-target best at bs=1 31.6 %). The win is the tokamax mosaic-TPU `linear_softmax_cross_entropy_loss` kernel: it streams logsumexp over V blocks in VMEM, avoiding a materialized `(B*L, V)` logits tensor (~6 GiB savings), which is what unlocks bs=3 (was OOM by 6 GiB in exp 44). fp32 master is essentially free at runtime (cast fused into matmul).
**Notes**:
- Tokamax CE bring-up notes (5 distinct issues, see milestone page table) — most-load-bearing was the absl-flags-vs-fire-args clash and the kernel always returning fp32 grads.
- **MFU formula bug**: `avg_step_time = total_time_after_warmup / (train_steps - warmup_steps)` divides by *planned* step count, but the wikitext loader exits early at high B → MFU inflated by `13/n_actual`. Numbers reported during the day for exp 51b (45.0 %), exp 51c (64.1 %), exp 53b (62.4 %) were artifacts of this bug. Corrected re-runs in exp 55-55c. Fix (hf-v26): `n_measured_steps` counter, divide by that.
- True AMP master pattern: `--weights_dtype=fp32 --compute_dtype=bf16`. weights stored fp32; `_maybe_cast_weights` autocasts each weight to bf16 before `functional_call`; the cast-vjp downcasts the bf16 grad back to fp32 on the way out, so the optimizer sees fp32 grads matching its fp32 mu/nu. Strict canonical AMP — no rounding into bf16 on parameter updates.
- bs=3 is the throughput sweet spot at seq=8192 — bs=2 / bs=4 both come in at ~6,000/chip (same MFU within ±1 pp), bs=3 hits 6,178/chip.
- **Post-acceptance follow-ups all refuted** (see milestone page §"Follow-ups tested"): (a) recipe XLA flags neutral/-0.3 %; (b) TP=2 / FSDP=4 -14 % on v6e-8; (c) VMEM=131,072 -0.7 %; (d) `dots_saveable` and `dots_with_no_batch_dims_saveable` remat policies OOM by 42 GiB at the scan body. The frontier converged at `nothing_saveable` + autotune + tokamax CE @ bs=3 seq=8192 = 6,206/chip, 34.8 % MFU. Next direction = xprof-driven profiling.
- Out-of-band TODO: copy the xprof trace tarball off `/tmp/llama3_profile/` on the GKE pod into `raw/profiles/2026-04-26-exp55b-fp32-master-tokamax/` before the post-run `sleep 600` expires.

## [2026-04-25] run-experiment-batch-2 | torchax Llama 3 8B v6e-8 — exp 9-11 (autotune ACCEPTED 36.1% MFU; remat REJECTED)

**Op**: run-experiment (×4: exp 9 + exp 10 + exp 11a/b/c) + protocol-extension (kernel-autotune-first for new shapes).
**Pages created**: `wiki/experiments/llama3_8B_autoresearch_optimization/torchax/experiments/2026-04-25-exp{9..11}-*.md` (4 pages); `raw/profiles/2026-04-25-llama3-8b-exp9-splash-autotuned/` + GCS mirror.
**Pages updated**: `wiki/index.md` (Experiments 10 → 13; llama3-8b model status → 36.1 % MFU; gap to MaxText 8.5 pp); `wiki/experiments/llama3_8B_autoresearch_optimization/torchax/{splash_attn.py, train.py}` — autotuned `BlockSizes` + remat patch on respective branches.
**Branches created** (2): `v6e8-llama3-8b-torchax-20260425-{exp9-splash-autotuned-bs4, exp11-remat}`. (exp 10 used the exp 8 image without code change; ran on the exp 9 branch.)
**Docker images**: `:hf-v3` (autotuned splash) and `:hf-v4` (`+ make_train_step with remat re-enabled`).
**Key result**:
- 🏆 **exp 9 ACCEPTED at 36.1 % MFU (7,225 TPS/chip, 57,799 TPS aggregate)** — exp 8's kernel-only autotune (+30 % kernel fwd+bwd) translates to +1.1 % TPS / +0.4 pp MFU end-to-end. Predicted +1.5–3.5 %; landed at low end (~half the kernel-saving converts because exp 3 was already partially overlapping attention with collectives). New program target.
- exp 10 (kernel autotune at seq=2048/4096/8192): same universal winner pattern. At seq=8192, `block_q=2048 block_kv=1024 fused_bwd=True dkv=(2048,2048)` = 7.944 ms / layer / chip → 254 ms attention budget for a seq=8192 step — feasible if memory fits.
- **exp 11 REJECTED at all 3 shapes**: 11a (bs=4 seq=1024) is 52 % slower than exp 9 (MFU 24.0 vs 36.1); 11b (bs=4 seq=2048) and 11c (bs=8 seq=1024) **still compile-OOM by 7+ GiB** — only 50 MiB less than exp 4 / 6 (no remat). `nothing_saveable` doesn't fix the OOM-driver, which is *not* activations.

**Discovery**: `torchax.train.make_train_step`'s `remat_policy` arg is **silently ignored** — `loss = interop.gradient_checkpoint(loss, ...)` is commented out in canonical `raw/code/torchax/torchax/train.py:54`. **All baseline + exp 1-10 ran with no remat.** exp 11 re-enables it via local `_make_train_step`. Filing as a torchax upstream issue is queued.

**Process retrofit**: per user direction, established the **kernel-autotune-first protocol for shape changes**: any new training shape gets a 3-min kernel-only autotune (via `tune_splash.py`) before the full training run is submitted. Documented in [exp 10](experiments/llama3_8B_autoresearch_optimization/torchax/experiments/2026-04-25-exp10-splash-autotune-multishape-potential.md).

**Notes / next**: Path to fp32-master + seq=8192 program target requires (a) memory unlock — scan-over-layers (gemma4-jax exp 49-51 confirms the architectural pattern); (b) selective remat (`dots_saveable` instead of `nothing_saveable` — avoid the 52 % step-time tax we measured); (c) tokamax `LinearSoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss` — Llama 3 has no softcap, so the gemma4 jax-exp43 blocker does NOT apply; ~128 MiB / chip activation savings; (d) host-offload of mu/nu — frees ~4 GiB / chip on the way to fp32 master. Ordered by EV: scan first (the unlock), then CE, then remat policy refinement, then fp32.

## [2026-04-25] run-experiment + methodology | torchax Llama 3 8B exp 8 — splash kernel-only autotune (POTENTIAL +30% kernel fwd+bwd at every shape; 3 min wall-clock)

**Op**: run-experiment + methodology-bootstrap (first kernel-only experiment in this wiki).
**Pages created**:
- `wiki/experiments/llama3_8B_autoresearch_optimization/torchax/experiments/2026-04-25-exp8-splash-kernel-autotune-potential.md` — full writeup.
- `raw/profiles/2026-04-25-exp8-splash-kernel-autotune/` — `rank0.log`, `rank1.log`, `results.csv` (171 configs × 14 cols, in-tree, 110 KiB).
- `wiki/experiments/llama3_8B_autoresearch_optimization/torchax/tune_splash.py` — reusable kernel-only autotune harness (~430 LOC, no extra deps beyond what's in the trainer image).
**Pages updated**:
- `wiki/index.md` — Experiments 9 → 10; bumped page count; updated llama3 model-status line with the new finding + queued exp 9 validation.
- `wiki/experiments/llama3_8B_autoresearch_optimization/torchax/experiments/README.md` — replaced stale gemma4-copy with llama3-specific contents + linked exp 8 prominently.
**Branches created**: none (kernel-only experiment; no production code change yet — the validated change happens in exp 9).
**Docker images**: `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/<your-project>/test/llama3-8b-torchax-container:tune-v1` (initial; had a clamping bug in the production-default anchor at seq=1024 — `block_q_dkv=2048 > seq_len=1024`); `:tune-v2` (fixed: clamp anchors with `min(global, seq_len)` to mirror production's clamping). Both layered on top of the `hf-v2` trainer image with only the new `tune_splash.py` baked in.

**Key result**: First **kernel-only** experiment in the program. Sweeps splash `BlockSizes × q_layout × use_fused_bwd_kernel` for the 3 in-program shapes (seq=1024 bs=2 baseline; seq=1024 bs=4 exp 3; seq=2048 bs=2 exp 5), single TPU v6e chip, 171 configs total. **Universal winner across all 3 shapes:** `block_q=1024, block_kv=1024, q_layout=HEAD_DIM_MINOR, use_fused_bwd_kernel=True, dkv=(seq_len, seq_len)`, beating the production default in [`splash_attn.py`](experiments/llama3_8B_autoresearch_optimization/torchax/splash_attn.py) by **+30.1 % to +32.4 % on fwd+bwd kernel time**, **+14.9 % to +16.4 % on fwd alone**. Production has `block_kv=512` (asymmetric, stale carryover from an older MaxText recipe) and `use_fused_bwd_kernel=False` — both wrong for these shapes. The autotune-best matches the current MaxText Llama 3.1-8B recipe within 0.2 %, independently confirming that recipe applies cleanly here. End-to-end TPS impact bounded by attention's share of step time: at seq=1024 ≈8 % share ⇒ expected +2.4 % step time ⇒ +2.4 % TPS; at seq=2048 ≈12 % share ⇒ expected +3.5 % TPS. Validation queued as exp 9 (full XPK training run with the autotune-best config).

**Methodological finding (the bigger one)**: end-to-end wall-clock for the 3-shape 171-config sweep was **3 minutes**. The equivalent set of full XPK training runs to test the same hypotheses one-by-one would be ~45-90 min wall-clock (15 min/run × 3-6 representative configs per shape × 3 shapes), and would resolve sub-2 % deltas as noise. Cross-host validation (rank 0 vs rank 1 timed independently on different chips of the same v6e-8 slice) showed **0.04-0.21 % agreement on best-config ms** — measurement noise floor far below the 30 % gain. Pattern to emulate: 1) build focused harness using upstream JAX kernels directly (rather than reusing tokamax + tune_jax — porting risk for direct applicability + 2 extra deps); 2) gate phase 2 on top-k from phase 1 to bound the search; 3) anchor every sweep with the production default + a public reference recipe so deltas are interpretable.

**Decision audit — build vs reuse**:
- [tokamax `splash_attention_benchmarking.py`](codebases/tokamax.md) — has a working harness with grid + xprof-event-filtered timing via `tune_jax`; rejected because tokamax has a *vendored* fork of splash that may differ from the upstream JAX path our model uses, and `tune_jax` is an extra pip dep. Borrowed the grid layout idea + `randn_init` pattern.
- [marin/levanter autotune harness](codebases/marin.md) — *in-graph* autotune cache for kernel selection at training time; wrong shape for this task (we want a standalone benchmark). Listed as the index-headline pattern to emulate for *future* in-trainer autotune (TBD when scope warrants).
- [maxtext splash kernel](codebases/maxtext.md) — has a frozen production splash wrapper but no autotune harness; consulted only for the recipe values used as the second anchor.

**Next hypotheses generated** (queued in the experiment page):
1. **Exp 9 — full-training validation of the autotune-best splash config** on top of exp 5 (seq=2048 trunk). One-line code change in [`splash_attn.py:42-53`](experiments/llama3_8B_autoresearch_optimization/torchax/splash_attn.py). Highest-priority follow-up. Effort: S.
2. **Exp 10 — autotune at seq=8192** (program target shape). Same harness, `--seq_len 8192 --batch_size 1`. At seq=8192 attention is ~25 % of step time, so 30 % kernel win ⇒ +7-8 % TPS. Effort: S.
3. **Exp 11 — combine autotune-best splash + bs=4 / seq=8192** (after exp 9). Test whether `use_fused_bwd_kernel=True` frees activation memory enough to unlock previously-OOM batch/seq combos.
4. **Phase-3 dq decoupling** — only if any future shape has a competitive `fused_bwd=False` row. In this run every non-fused config was strictly dominated. Defer.
5. **Promote `tune_splash.py` to a generic Pallas kernel autotune harness** for future kernels (RMSNorm Pallas re-attempt, fused softcap+CE, etc). Captured as a methodology line in the experiment README.

**Notes** — bug found in iteration 1 (image `tune-v1`): the `production_default_full()` config in the harness used the literal `block_q_dkv=2048` value from `splash_attn.py`, but production *clamps* with `min(2048, seq_len)` at runtime. At `seq_len=1024` the harness threw `q_block_size=2048 should divide q_seq_len=1024`. Fix in `tune-v2`: thread `seq_len` into anchor constructors and clamp consistently. **Process retrofit**: when porting production code into a benchmark harness, include the clamp/min logic that ships with the production wrapper, not just the literal constants. Workload `llama3-splash-tune-20260425-191044` (`tune-v2`) succeeded end-to-end in 100 s + image pull/init. The earlier `llama3-splash-tune-20260425-190746` (`tune-v1`) was deleted after seq=1024 sweep failed at the bug above; ~2 min lost.

## [2026-04-25] run-experiment-batch | torchax Llama 3 8B v6e-8 — 7 experiments, splash+bs=4 ACCEPTED (35.7% MFU, +12.8 pp)

**Op**: run-experiment (×7) + formulate-hypothesis (×1) + protocol-update (program.md branch convention).
**Pages created**: `wiki/experiments/llama3_8B_autoresearch_optimization/torchax/experiments/2026-04-25-exp{1..7}-*.md` (7 experiment pages); `wiki/hypotheses/llama3-torchax-xla-recipe-flags.md` (hypothesis page); `raw/profiles/2026-04-25-llama3-8b-exp3-splash-bs4/` + `gs://<your-bucket>/autoresearch/2026-04-25-llama3-8b-exp3-splash-bs4/` (winner profile, both ranks); `raw/profiles/2026-04-25-llama3-8b-exp5-splash-seq2k/` + GCS mirror.
**Pages updated**: `wiki/index.md` (Experiments 4 → 9; llama3-8b model status → 35.7 % MFU); `wiki/experiments/llama3_8B_autoresearch_optimization/program.md` (added "Experiment branch" binding row — convention `v6e8-llama3-8b-torchax-<YYYYMMDD>-exp<NN>-<short-slug>`); `wiki/experiments/llama3_8B_autoresearch_optimization/torchax/train.py` (added `--use_splash` flag + `env.override_op_definition(F.scaled_dot_product_attention, …)` canonical splash wiring on the splash-using branches).
**Branches created** (8): `v6e8-llama3-8b-torchax-20260425-{baseline, exp1-xla-recipe-flags, exp2-splash-bs2, exp3-splash-bs4, exp4-splash-bs8, exp5-splash-seq2k, exp6-splash-bs4-seq2k, exp7-splash-xla-bs4}`.
**Docker images**: `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/<your-project>/test/llama3-8b-torchax-container:hf-v1` (baseline + exp1; no splash) and `:hf-v2` (exp2-exp7; splash override).
**Key result**: **exp 3 (splash + bs=4) ACCEPTED** — 57,154 TPS aggregate (7,144/chip), 35.7 % MFU at `bs=4 seq=1024 fsdp=8` on v6e-8. **+55.6 % TPS, +12.8 pp MFU vs baseline.** Mechanism: splash makes attention activation `O(L)` which frees enough HBM that `bs=4` fits (it OOM'd by 1 GiB on the no-splash baseline); the doubled per-chip token count amortizes non-attention compute across 2× the work, lifting per-token MFU. Splash itself at `bs=2` (exp 2) is +1.6 % within noise — it is the precondition, not the wing.

**Ranking by verdict**:
- 🏆 exp 3 splash+bs=4 = **35.7 % MFU** — accepted (current target).
- exp 5 splash+seq=2048 = 34.0 % MFU — accepted (alternate path to seq=8192).
- exp 7 splash+xla-flags = 35.0 % MFU — refuted (flags don't help at this density).
- exp 2 splash@baseline = 23.3 % MFU — potential (precondition only).
- exp 6 splash+bs=4+seq=2048 = compile OOM — invalid.
- exp 4 splash+bs=8 = compile OOM 7.36 GiB — invalid.
- exp 1 xla-flags@baseline = 22.6 % MFU — refuted.

**Notes**: New durable heuristic captured: **MaxText recipe XLA flags require per-chip B·L ≳ ~10,000 to pay for themselves** (recipe is bs=3 seq=8192 = 24,576; we are at 4,096). At lower B·L, FSDP all-gather is already fully hidden behind compute and the flags are no-ops. Compile time penalty is +6–17 s. Don't enable speculatively until compute density justifies.

**OOM mechanism — bs=8 and bs=4-seq=2048 both crash** because splash compresses attention activations (`O(L²)` → `O(L)`) but not the FFN intermediate `[B, L, 14336]` which is the largest bf16 activation in the train graph. Both OOMs converge on the same path forward: **selective remat that recomputes the FFN intermediate** (`save_only_these_names = {hidden_state}`-style), or **scan-over-layers** to share the FFN intermediate buffer across all 32 layers (also ~32× compile-time reduction). Queued as next experiments.

**Compile cache write permission denied** persists on the gcsfuse `/data/cache/xla` mount — every run cold-compiles 70-110 s. Investigated to gcsfuse mount config (UID mismatch — pod cannot write the bucket). First fix attempt: switch to `/tmp` + post-run sync script (queued).

**Process retrofit**: per user direction, established the **per-experiment branch convention**: `v6e8-llama3-8b-torchax-<YYYYMMDD>-exp<NN>-<short-slug>` (or `…-baseline`). Each branch holds the exact `train.py` + `model/` + `data.py` state used for that run plus the experiment page; even env-only experiments get a branch. Documented in `program.md`. Backfilled all 7 experiments (today's batch) onto their respective branches.

**Gap to MaxText reference (44.6 % MFU)**: 8.9 pp remaining. Most likely sources (in order): (a) compute density — MaxText recipe is bs=3 seq=8192, B·L = 24,576 vs our 4,096; selective remat / scan + bs=4 seq=8192 would close most of this. (b) framework overhead — JittableModule + torchax interop vs MaxText's pure-JAX hand-tuned graph; +1–3 pp at most. (c) kernel choice / scheduler — minor.



**Op**: run-experiment.
**Pages created**: `wiki/experiments/llama3_8B_autoresearch_optimization/torchax/experiments/2026-04-25-baseline.md`; `raw/profiles/2026-04-25-llama3-8b-baseline/` (mirror of GCS, 668 MiB, both ranks); `gs://<your-bucket>/autoresearch/2026-04-25-llama3-8b-baseline/`.
**Pages updated**: `wiki/index.md` (Models entry for llama3-8b updated with torchax baseline; Experiments count 2→3; total page count bumped); `wiki/experiments/llama3_8B_autoresearch_optimization/torchax/{train.py, Dockerfile, DEPLOY.md, model/, data.py, helper.py, splash_attn.py}` — full restructure of the trainer code per the program README requirements (HF `LlamaForCausalLM` + `model/` re-export package + `data.py` wikitext loader + canonical-pattern `train.py` from `raw/code/torchax/examples/train_llama_torchtitan/` + Dockerfile + generic GKE-deployment guide).
**Key result**: First end-to-end run of the HuggingFace-`transformers`-based Llama 3 8B torchax trainer on multi-host GKE. Local v6e-4 single-host (5,450 tok/s/chip, MFU 27.2 %) and v6e-8 multi-host **(canonical: 36,729 tok/s = 4,591 tok/s/chip, MFU 22.9 % at bs=2 seq=1024 fsdp=8)** both stable at steady state. Multi-host −16 % per-chip vs local — the FSDP collective tax across the 2-host slice is the first optimization target. MFU formula switched from rough `6N · tokens` to the MaxText `calculate_tflops_training_per_device` per-component formula (qkv + o_proj + ffn + lm_head + causal-attn, ×3 for fwd+2·bwd), which drops the embedding-table flops since lookup is gather not matmul. Verdict: `supported`.
**Notes**: Significant infrastructure work — from-scratch rewrite of the trainer using the canonical torchax pattern (`sharded_device_put`, `create_sharded_weights` with `make_array_from_callback`, `JittableModule`, `torchax.train.make_train_step`, `helper.compile_step_func` with `donate_argnums + cost analysis`, `axis_types=(Auto, Auto)` mesh). The torchtitan-shape canonical does not work on HF Llama directly without three fixes documented in the experiment page: (1) **buffer materialization** for HF's `model.rotary_emb.{inv_freq, original_inv_freq}` (meta-init leaves them unmaterialized; `interop.jax_view` crashes); (2) **opt_state count-scalar replication** — optax `adamw`'s `count` 0-d int32 lands on device-0 only and collides with `compile_step_func`'s out_shardings; walk the pytree post-init and `jax.device_put`-replicate any leaf whose device set is smaller than the mesh; (3) **batch=4 OOM** at compile (4 GiB over on v6e-4, 1.05 GiB over on v6e-8), so canonical baseline is bs=2. **Compile cache write permission denied** on the gcsfuse `/data/cache/xla` mount (PermissionError — pod's UID can't write the bucket); JAX falls through but no warm-cache reuse, so every run cold-compiles ~92 s — first follow-up hypothesis. New stack folder `wiki/experiments/llama3_8B_autoresearch_optimization/torchax/` already existed (it housed the earlier torchtitan-based trainer); this run replaces all torchax code top-to-bottom with the HF-based version. Image rebuilt + pushed: `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/<your-project>/test/llama3-8b-torchax-container:hf-v1`. Next priority: hypothesis #1 (compile-cache fix → 82 s/run saved); then splash attention (#2); then batch=4 (#3) and async-collective flags (#4). 7 follow-up hypotheses listed inline in the experiment page; convert to standalone hypothesis pages before scheduling.

## [2026-04-25] run-experiment | MaxText Gemma 4 E4B v6e-8 baseline (SUPPORTED-as-approximation, 282.9 TFLOP/s/device, 30.8% MFU)

**Op**: run-experiment.
**Pages created**: `wiki/experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/maxtext/{README.md, experiments/README.md, experiments/2026-04-25-maxtext-gemma4-e4b-v6e8-baseline.md}`; `raw/profiles/2026-04-25-maxtext-gemma4-e4b-v6e8-baseline/` (mirror of GCS, ~133 MiB; canonical at `gs://<your-bucket>/maxtext/v6e8-20260425-02-gemma4-e4b/<workload-name>/`); `/mnt/disks/persist/maxtext-main/src/maxtext/configs/models/gemma4-e4b.yml` (NEW wiki-local model config — no upstream equivalent exists).
**Pages updated**: `wiki/experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/README.md` (added maxtext stack pointer); `/mnt/disks/persist/maxtext-main/src/maxtext/configs/types.py:239` (1-line literal-whitelist patch — required so Pydantic accepts `model_name=gemma4-e4b`).
**Key result**: First-ever MaxText Gemma 4 E4B-shape run on Trillium v6e-8: **282.9 TFLOP/s/device, 10,003 Tokens/s/device, 30.8% per-chip MFU** at `bs=2, seq=8192, fsdp=8, remat_policy=full`, aggregate ~80k tok/s across 8 chips. Compile fits at 22.51 GiB / 31.25 GiB HBM. **APPROXIMATION** — HF E4B's `num_kv_shared_layers=18` (last 18 layers reuse K/V from earlier same-type layers) is not implemented by MaxText's `gemma4` decoder_block; the run has +47M extra k/v projection params (~0.6% over true E4B). Throughput is a measurement of the dense-shape model that this config builds, not directly comparable to a true E4B implementation.
**Notes**: Substantial infrastructure work — Gemma 4 support landed on MaxText `main` after `tpu-recipes-v0.1.4` (we ran Llama-8B against v0.1.4 earlier today; for E4B we had to switch to `main` @ `532c8b3d8` and rebuild `maxtext_base_image` from scratch (1.77 GiB, py3.12 base, ~5 min build incl. 2-min layer export)). Five workload submissions: -mt-1 hit Pydantic literal_error (model_name not whitelisted), -mt-2 same error (PYTHONPATH issue — base image had editable install at `/deps/src` that overrode xpk's `/app/src` COPY; fixed with `PYTHONPATH=/app/src` in user_command), -mt-3 hit "Unknown command line flag '2a886c8_chip_config_name'" (newer libtpu rejected one of the Llama-recipe LIBTPU_INIT_ARGS flags; stripped to just `--xla_tpu_scoped_vmem_limit_kib=98304`), -mt-4 OOM at compile (`bs=4 seq=8192` with `remat=full` doesn't fit — FFN intermediate `bf16[4,8192,10240]` × ~20 buffers = 13+ GiB live), -mt-5 succeeded at `bs=2`. **MFU is 13.8 pp lower than the same-day Llama-3.1-8B baseline (44.6%)** — drivers: smaller compute density, `remat=full` overhead, missing recipe-tuned XLA flags. Item 1 in next-hypotheses queue is to port the LIBTPU_INIT_ARGS set (minus version-rejected flag). Hybrid attention pattern (5 SW + 1 GLOBAL × 7 cycles) drives both more compile time (~50 s HLO compile vs Llama's ~12 s) and a ~4× larger xplane trace (133 vs 31 MiB) since each cycle compiles distinct kernels. Loss flat (12.97-12.98 over 20 steps, synthetic data — no real signal at this scale; ln(262144) = 12.477 is the uniform-vocab baseline; the slight excess reflects synthetic-data variance not a broken model). Workload `<workload-name>` cleaned up after run.

## [2026-04-25] run-experiment | MaxText Llama3.1-8B v6e-8 reference baseline (SUPPORTED, 409.4 TFLOP/s/device, 44.6% MFU)

**Op**: run-experiment.
**Pages created**: `wiki/experiments/llama3_8B_autoresearch_optimization/maxtext/README.md`; `wiki/experiments/llama3_8B_autoresearch_optimization/maxtext/experiments/README.md`; `wiki/experiments/llama3_8B_autoresearch_optimization/maxtext/experiments/2026-04-25-maxtext-llama3-1-8b-v6e8-baseline.md`; `raw/profiles/2026-04-25-maxtext-llama3-1-8b-v6e8-baseline/` (mirror of `gs://<your-bucket>/maxtext/v6e8-20260425-01-llama3-1-8b/<workload-name>/`).
**Pages updated**: `wiki/experiments/llama3_8B_autoresearch_optimization/README.md` (added maxtext stack pointer with MFU number).
**Key result**: Wired the MaxText stack to the autoresearch v6e-8 GKE cluster `<your-v6e8-cluster>` (which `program-gke.md` had marked TODO across all three GKE clusters) and ran the official `tpu-recipes-v0.1.4` Llama3.1-8B v6e-8 recipe (`llama3_1_8b_8192_no_collective_matmul`, fsdp=8 seq=8192 bs=3) end-to-end through xpk + `benchmark_runner xpk`. Steady-state median over steps 11–14 + 16–19: **409.42 TFLOP/s/device, 7,069.66 Tokens/s/device, 44.6 % MFU** (per-chip vs Trillium 918 TFLOP/s bf16 peak); aggregate 56.6k tok/s across 8 chips. Reproduces recipe README's published 413.4 / 7,138.9 within **−1.0 %** on both metrics — well inside run-to-run noise. Verdict: `supported`.
**Notes**: Infrastructure decisions worth carrying forward: (a) MaxText worktree at `tpu-recipes-v0.1.4` placed at `/mnt/disks/persist/maxtext-tpu-recipes-v0.1.4` per SCHEMA rule 1 (raw/code/maxtext stays on main); (b) local maxtext venv at `/mnt/disks/persist/venv-maxtext-v0.1.4` (uv + py3.12), `MAXTEXT_README`'s `uv pip install -e .[tpu] --resolution=lowest` path doesn't work as written (absl-py 0.1.0 build failure under py3.12; tensorboardx version conflict in jax-stable-stack-0.6.1 reqs file) — the working recipe is `uv pip install -e .[tpu] --prerelease=allow` then patch in `omegaconf grain ruamel.yaml jaxtyping aqtp ml-goodput-measurement google-cloud-aiplatform google-cloud-monitoring google-jetstream cloud-tpu-diagnostics`; (c) `maxtext_base_image` is **1.81 GiB** (much smaller than the torchtitan image, ~11 GiB) so docker build + push is fast (2–3 min total); (d) xpk needs to be cloned to `~/xpk` exactly (path required by `XPK_README.md` and benchmark_runner default `xpk_path`). HBM peak was 10.66 GiB / 31.25 GiB (34 %) — large headroom for `bs=4` and projection-offload ablations as next hypotheses. Loss trajectory monotone-decreasing (12.264 → 1.792); model is training. xprof URL: `http://localhost:8791/?run=2026-04-25-maxtext-llama3-1-8b-v6e8-baseline` (after `xprof --logdir=raw/profiles --port=8791`). New stack folder `wiki/experiments/llama3_8B_autoresearch_optimization/maxtext/` distinguishes "reference baseline (don't optimize, just reproduce)" runs from the optimization-target `torchax/` and `jax/` stacks; mirrors the gemma4 program's per-stack split.

## [2026-04-25] ingest-codebase | tpu-recipes (AI-Hypercomputer/tpu-recipes @ e284e361)

**Op**: ingest-codebase.
**Pages created**: `wiki/codebases/tpu-recipes.md`.
**Pages updated**: `wiki/index.md` (Codebases count 26→27; new entry under Wave 4 ecosystem); `README.md` (new bullet under "Reference trainers & inference engines"); `.gitmodules` (new submodule entry).
**Submodule added**: `raw/code/tpu-recipes` → `https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/tpu-recipes.git` @ commit `e284e3613721882ce3e15c533a76c691443ea60f`.
**Key result**: AI-Hypercomputer's curated per-(model, hardware, topology) reproduction recipes on Cloud TPU. Each recipe pins a MaxText tag (e.g. `tpu-recipes-v0.1.4`), a `jax-stable-stack` Docker image (e.g. `jax0.6.1-rev1`), the launch command, and the **MaxText `tuning_params` block** used to hit the published throughput target. Coverage: Trillium (v6e-32/64/128/256) + Ironwood (v7x 4×4×4 / 4×8×8) for Llama 3.1 (8B/70B/405B), Gemma 3-12B, Gemma 4-26B/31B, Mixtral 8×7B / 8×22B, DeepSeek 3-671B, Qwen 3-235B, GPT-OSS 120B, Wan 2.1-14B, GPT-3 175B; legacy v5p tier. Plus `microbenchmarks/` (matmul TFLOPS + HBM bandwidth on v6e-1) and `utils/profile_convert.py` (`.xplane.pb` → text).
**Notes**: Single most direct public source for "what flags Google's perf team picked for this combination." Closest external precedent for the gemma4 program here: the `Gemma3-12B-MaxText/v6e-*` recipes (family + scale) and the published `Llama3.1-70B-MaxText/v6e-32` `tuning_params` block (`remat_policy: custom`, `decoder_layer_input: offload`, `query_proj/key_proj/value_proj: offload`, `per_device_batch_size: 2`). Future hypotheses touching `remat_policy` or per-projection offload should cite the closest matching recipe as the prior. Microbenchmark harness usable to establish v6e-1 chip-level rooflines (matmul ~827 TFLOPS bf16 8192³ with `xla_tpu_scoped_vmem_limit_kib=65536`; HBM ~1359 GB/s 32 MiB copy) — useful when an op-profile roofline classification is in dispute. No subpages created (recipe `READMEs` are themselves the leaves; no perf-relevant subsystems warrant their own wiki page).

## [2026-04-24] analyze + run-experiment | jax-exp53: splash block-size sweep under new regime (REJECTED, flat) + new-regime ceiling analysis

**Op**: run-experiment + analyze.
**Pages created**: `wiki/experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/jax/experiments/2026-04-24-exp53-jax-splash-block-sweep-fp32master-rejected.md`; `wiki/analyses/2026-04-24-gemma4-jax-fp32master-seq8k-regime.md` (new-regime ceiling analysis); `raw/profiles/2026-04-24-gemma4-jax-exp53-splash-block512-seq2k-fp32master/` + `gs://<your-bucket>/autoresearch/2026-04-24-gemma4-jax-exp53-splash-block512-seq2k-fp32master/`.
**Pages updated**: `.../jax/experiments/RESULTS.tsv` (exp53 discard row); `.../jax/experiments/OBSERVATIONS.md` (exp 53 block + ceiling pointer).
**Key result**: **exp 53 REJECTED** — splash block-size sweep at seq=2048 b=1 fp32-master is flat. Block=2048 (full-tile) hits `CompileTimeScopedVmemOom` (32.14/32.00 MiB, 144 KiB over). Block=512 runs at 26,807 TPS, dead flat vs exp 52's default block=1024 (−0.0 %). Confirms the old-regime exp 48 plateau transfers to the new regime. **Ceiling analysis filed** covering seq=8192 infeasibility on v6e-4 (independent of AMP — legacy bf16 also OOMs), XLA non-monotonic compile-time peak, `nothing_saveable`/offload counter-intuitive regression, and the three-branch forward path (A: optimize at seq=2048; B: v6e-8 mesh; C: memory-saving code changes).
**Notes**: New durable heuristic for program.md: "Splash block size is flat across all measured Gemma 4 E4B shapes on v6e-4 with the fused_bwd kernel + SEQ_MINOR layout — don't open a new block-size experiment unless the shape or kernel changes materially." Still-open exp 52 follow-ups queued in the new-regime ceiling page: exp 54 (pure-AMP isolation at b=1 s=1024), exp 55 (scan_layers at new regime), exp 56 (2D mesh dp=2 tp=2), exp 57 (PLE embedding host-offload). xprof browser URL for exp 53: http://localhost:8791/?run=2026-04-24-gemma4-jax-exp53-splash-block512-seq2k-fp32master.

## [2026-04-24] run-experiment | jax-exp52: fp32-master + bf16-compute AMP new-regime baseline (seq=8192 OOMs on v6e-4; seq=2048 b=1 accepted at 26,807 TPS)

**Op**: run-experiment (regime change + new-baseline establishment).
**Pages created**: `wiki/experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/jax/experiments/2026-04-24-exp52-jax-fp32master-seq2k-accepted.md`; `raw/profiles/2026-04-24-gemma4-jax-exp52-baseline-seq2k-fp32master/` (on-disk xprof profile, gitignored) + `gs://<your-bucket>/autoresearch/2026-04-24-gemma4-jax-exp52-baseline-seq2k-fp32master/` (GCS mirror).
**Pages updated**: `.../jax/experiments/RESULTS.tsv` (exp52 keep row); `.../jax/experiments/OBSERVATIONS.md` (exp 52 block); `.../jax/experiments/README.md` (new "Current state" section split between old-regime and new-regime baselines); `.../jax/train.py` (new `--weights-dtype` / `--compute-dtype` CLI, seq_len default 2048 → 8192, `JAX_REMAT_POLICY` env var, reordered apply_sharding before load_hf_weights); `.../jax/model/modeling_gemma4.py` (all modules accept split weights_dtype / compute_dtype kwargs; Linear downcasts weight to compute_dtype at matmul; embed_tokens casts output to compute_dtype; layer_scalar casts to hidden dtype); `.../jax/model/weight_loader.py` (optional `shardings=` scatter-shards fp32 directly into sharded NNX params, avoiding a 10.5 GiB fp32 PLE on-device-0 init OOM); `.../jax/model/scan_layers.py` (_matmul_amp helper + layer_scalar-cast for AMP correctness); `.../torchax/train.py` (flag parity stubs; warns + falls back to --dtype on split); commits 517a689 + 176fd2c + flag-wiring squash.
**Key result**: **KEEP as new-regime baseline**. User asked for `seq_len=8192 b=1 fp32-master + bf16-compute` and the optimization loop to run there. seq=8192 b=1 fp32-master is **INFEASIBLE on v6e-4**: compile OOM at 35.18 GiB / 31.25 GiB per-chip HBM (exceeded by 3.93 GiB). Even legacy bf16-only at seq=8192 b=1 OOMs (36.16 GiB, exceeded 4.91 GiB). Intermediate seq_lens are WORSE than seq=8192 due to XLA scheduling non-monotonicity (seq=4096 = 39.58 GiB; seq=6144 = 49.66 GiB). Largest-feasible new-regime config: **seq=2048 b=1 fp32-master = 26,807 TPS, 305.6 ms/step**, loss descent 3.25 → 2.30 clean. −15.7 % vs exp 40 (bf16-only b=2 s=2048 at 31,809 TPS; b=2 is itself infeasible under fp32 master — 39.37 GiB OOM). Exp 36 (bf16 single-dtype, s=1024 b=3 at 34,614 TPS) remains the **old-regime** JAX best; exp 52 is the new-regime baseline.
**Notes**: AMP implementation is JAX-only; torchax gets CLI-parity stubs that warn + fall back to legacy `--dtype` (HF PyTorch takes a single torch_dtype; full torchax wiring is out of scope). Flag wiring: modules accept kwargs (weights_dtype for storage, compute_dtype for matmul); Linear does `x @ W.astype(compute_dtype).T` at call time — single fp32→bf16 cast per forward, XLA folds into the dot when it can. NO hand-casts beyond that needed (no need for `jax.lax.dot_general` with explicit dtype promotion). `nothing_saveable` and `offload_dot_with_no_batch_dims` remat policies **increase** compile-time peak HBM (39.66 and 38.17 GiB at seq=8192 respectively, vs default's 35.18 GiB) — XLA planner does not credit offload as HBM-freed; nothing_saveable serializes more live tensors to avoid recomputing. JAX_SCAN_LAYERS=1 saves 0.35 GiB at fp32-master seq=8192 and 3.7 GiB at bf16-legacy seq=8192, not enough to close the gap. Weight-loader refactor: `shardings={path: NamedSharding}` kwarg scatter-shards each tensor through a host numpy buffer → per-device HBM directly, so the fp32 PLE embedding (11 GiB) never materializes on device 0; needed because NNX inline init runs on device 0 by default. Apply_sharding moved before load_hf_weights so the shardings lookup is available. Init-in-bf16 workaround: even though weights_dtype=fp32, the random-init pass is in bf16 to fit device 0; the loader overwrites with fp32 sharded values; a `_fixup_dtype_meta` pass retargets per-module weights_dtype attributes for introspection. Follow-up queue documented in experiment page: (1) pure-AMP isolation at b=1 s=1024, (2) splash block sweep at seq=2048 fp32-master, (3) scan_layers at seq=2048 fp32-master, (4) 2D mesh dp=2,tp=2 at seq=8192 (K/V replication on tp=2 permitted since num_kv_heads=2), (5) PLE embedding host-offload (risky code change). xprof_mcp access is currently pointing at a different GCS logdir; direct URL for the uploaded profile: http://localhost:8791/?run=2026-04-24-gemma4-jax-exp52-baseline-seq2k-fp32master (resolves once server is re-pointed at the autoresearch bucket).

## [2026-04-24] run-experiment | jax-exp47: marin/levanter fused linear+softcap+CE Pallas kernel — REJECTED (−5.61 % TPS, custom-call + all-gather tax)

**Op**: run-experiment.
**Pages created**: `wiki/experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/jax/experiments/2026-04-24-exp47-jax-levanter-ce-rejected.md`; `wiki/experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/jax/model/kernels/__init__.py` and `.../kernels/fused_ce/__init__.py` (import shim); `wiki/experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/jax/tools/parity_levanter_ce.py` (correctness harness); `raw/profiles/2026-04-24-gemma4-jax-exp47-levanter-ce/` (xprof profile, gitignored).
**Pages updated**: `.../jax/experiments/RESULTS.tsv` (exp47 discard row), `.../jax/experiments/OBSERVATIONS.md` (exp 47 block), `.../jax/train.py` (`JAX_CE_IMPL=levanter` branch + shard_map wrapper + sharded levanter call), `.../jax/model/modeling_gemma4.py` (`Gemma4ForCausalLM.__call__(return_hidden=True)` kwarg + `lm_head_weight()` helper).
**Key result**: **REJECTED**. TPS 34,614 → **32,671 (−5.61 %)**; step time 355.0 → **376.1 ms (+5.95 %)**; parity **PASS** (|diff| 0.048 vs tol 0.05 in bf16); smoke step-4 loss 2.1875 → 2.1979 (+0.47 %, within 5 % bar). The softcap gap from exp 43 is closed — levanter's `fused_cross_entropy_loss_and_logsumexp_penalty` applies `sc * tanh(logits/sc)` inline on each VMEM logits-tile before the streaming softmax (`raw/code/marin/lib/levanter/src/levanter/kernels/pallas/fused_cross_entropy_loss/reference.py:11`), so `[B, S, V]` logits never materialize in HBM. Regression root cause is the same Pallas-custom-call tax as torchax exp 33 (Pallas RMSNorm, −36 ms/step): CE in exp 36 was <3 % of step time and XLA-fused with lm_head + softcap + log_softmax; replacing a tight 10-ms XLA fusion with a 3.5-ms Pallas kernel adds ~15 ms of custom-call boundary + the 1.31-GiB `w_hv` all-gather that the shard_map wrapper forces (lm_head weight is FSDP-sharded on V, kernel requires replicated `[H, V]`). Exp 36 remains JAX-stack best at 34,614 TPS.
**Notes**: Pre-run gates done per SCHEMA run-experiment op: parity harness before smoke, smoke before benchmark, profile captured during benchmark. Block sizes hand-picked (`b=1024, h=256, v=512`): default `(1024, 512, 1024)` overruns 32 MiB VMEM on v6e; `b_block` must be ≥1024 because per-shard flat batch B*S=3072 ≥ 1024 (kernel invariant in `pallas_tpu.py:227`); Gemma 4's shape (V=262144, H=2560) lands in no TPU-tuned bucket (`tuned_block_sizes.py` TPU buckets top out at V=131072). Durable artifacts: `JAX_CE_IMPL=levanter` gate + `jax/model/kernels/fused_ce/` import shim (levanter kernel importable without installing equinox/draccus/rigging via `sys.modules` stubs); `jax/tools/parity_levanter_ce.py` correctness harness; `Gemma4ForCausalLM.__call__(return_hidden=True)` + `lm_head_weight()` seam for future CE-replacement variants. Follow-ups: retry at seq=2048 b=2 (logits pressure higher, cost/benefit may flip); V-sharded kernel variant (removes the w_hv all-gather, kernel-edit effort M); `collective-permute-done` audit unchanged from exp 36's queue. Profile local only (`raw/profiles/2026-04-24-gemma4-jax-exp47-levanter-ce/`, 328 MiB) + GCS mirror at `gs://<your-bucket>/autoresearch/2026-04-24-gemma4-jax-exp47-levanter-ce/` (326.6 MiB uploaded). xprof browser access blocked in this account's logdir (same as other recent JAX-stack experiments). Promotes the "Pallas custom-call tax" heuristic to a general rule: swapping a Pallas kernel in for an XLA-fused op that is <5 % of step time tends to lose fusion more than it gains kernel speed.

## [2026-04-24] run-experiment | jax-exp43: tokamax.linear_softmax_cross_entropy_loss — INVALID (API-precondition failure, no softcap support)

**Op**: run-experiment.
**Pages created**: `wiki/experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/jax/experiments/2026-04-23-exp43-jax-tokamax-ce-rejected.md`.
**Pages updated**: `.../jax/experiments/RESULTS.tsv` (exp43 discard row), `.../jax/experiments/OBSERVATIONS.md` (exp 43 block), `.../jax/experiments/README.md` (Current state paragraph adds exp 43 line; exp 36 remains best).
**Key result**: **INVALID** — no run performed. tokamax `v0.0.12` public API `tokamax.linear_softmax_cross_entropy_loss(x, labels, weights, *, reduction, precision, implementation)` has **no** `logits_soft_cap` (or equivalent) kwarg (verified across `api.py`, `base.py`, `reference.py`, and the 690-line `pallas_mosaic_tpu_kernel.py`). Gemma 4's `final_logit_softcapping=30.0` is a non-linear `sc * tanh(logits / sc)` element-wise on the `[B, S, V]` logits — cannot be folded into `hidden` or `W` (algebraically impossible for non-linear post-matmul ops), and applying post-kernel requires materializing `[B, S, V]` which defeats the kernel's sole purpose. Skipping softcap violates program.md "What you CANNOT do". Zero lines of code merged. Exp 36 remains JAX-stack best at 34,614 TPS / 86.75 % HBM.
**Notes**: Decision-tree exit per task brief: "Softcap incompatible with tokamax API → can't apply cleanly → `-invalid`. Don't merge." The result **empirically confirms** the build-target already catalogued in [program.md § "Pallas kernels to BUILD" → "Fused final logit softcap + log-softmax + NLL"](experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/program.md) — a Gemma-aware kernel fork that applies `sc * tanh(logits_tile / sc)` inline on each VMEM block before `log_softmax` is the only correct path to the ~1.5 GiB HBM save on this model. Estimated effort M (extend mosaic_tpu_kernel.py with a softcap pre-op). Secondary API mismatches also noted: no `ignore_index`; `reduction="mean"` divides by `B*S` instead of `mask.sum()`; `x` wants `[B, H]` flat (easy reshape). These are ~15-line glue, non-blocking — softcap is the hard blocker. Note: torchax exp 27's prior tokamax integration attempt failed on **attention** (`dot_product_attention` / sliding-window masks) — exp 43 is the first tokamax-CE attempt on either stack, and fails at a different API seam.

## [2026-04-23] run-experiment | jax-exp37: bf16 CE env-var gate on top of exp 36 — POTENTIAL (flat, no-op-by-construction)

**Op**: run-experiment.
**Pages created**: `wiki/experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/jax/experiments/2026-04-23-exp37-jax-splash-b3-bf16ce-potential.md`.
**Pages updated**: `.../jax/experiments/RESULTS.tsv` (exp37 parked row), `.../jax/experiments/OBSERVATIONS.md` (exp 37 block), `.../jax/experiments/README.md` (Current state + queued exp list — exp 37 resolved, exp 38 now highest priority), `.../jax/train.py` (added `JAX_CE_DTYPE` gate).
**Key result**: **POTENTIAL (flat, within noise)**. TPS 34,614 → **34,629 (+0.04 %)**; step time 355.0 → 354.85 ms; peak HBM 27.11 → 27.45 GiB (heap unchanged at 10.67 GiB, stack +0.34 GiB). Loss matches exp 36 within 0.3 %. Exp 36 remains JAX-stack best at 34,614 TPS.
**Notes**: The torchax exp 12 analog (+3.0 % TPS / −1.5 GiB HBM) replicated as a **no-op** on the JAX port: the native-JAX port never had the `flat_logits.to(fp32)` upcast that torchax inherited — `forward_loss` in `jax/train.py` has been bf16 log_softmax by construction since the exp-34 port. The durable artifact from exp 37 is the `JAX_CE_DTYPE={bf16,fp32}` env-var gate, which enables controlled A/B on future refactors (e.g., if exp 39 Pallas RMSNorm changes upstream dtype flow). HLO graph bit-identical to exp 36 aside from one dropped implicit-cast in the CE reduction. Profile uploaded to `gs://<your-bucket>/autoresearch/2026-04-23-gemma4-jax-exp37-splash-b3-bf16ce/`; xprof at http://localhost:8791/?run=2026-04-23-gemma4-jax-exp37-splash-b3-bf16ce. Next priority: exp 38 (collective-permute-done sharding audit, 12.1 % of step time).

## [2026-04-23] run-experiment | jax-exp36: splash + batch=3 — new JAX-stack best, BEATS torchax session-best (+3.7 %)

**Op**: run-experiment.
**Pages created**: `wiki/experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/jax/experiments/2026-04-23-exp36-jax-splash-batch3-accepted.md`.
**Pages updated**: `.../jax/experiments/RESULTS.tsv` (exp36 keep row), `.../jax/experiments/OBSERVATIONS.md` (exp 36 block), `.../jax/experiments/README.md` (Current state + queued exp list).
**Key result**: **SUPPORTED / accepted**. TPS 30,386 → **34,614 (+13.9 %)**; step time 134.8 → 355.0 ms (sub-linear at 3× batch — per-token cost −13.9 %); peak HBM 16.43 → **27.11 GiB / 86.75 %** (4.14 GiB free). The JAX stack at b=3 splash **surpasses torchax session-best** (exp 25: 33,372 TPS) by **+3.7 %** without bf16 CE. HLO-op diff validates the per-call-amortization mechanism: splash `custom fusion` near-constant (169 → 175 ms, ×1.03) while matmul/loop fusions grew 2.75–3.81×.
**Notes**: No code change — only `--batch_size 1` → `--batch_size 3` and `JAX_ATTENTION_IMPL=splash` env var unchanged from exp 35. Loss descends cleanly 3.81 → 1.84 (b=3 batch content differs from b=1, not bit-comparable; trajectory healthy). New bottleneck surfaces at b=3: `loop fusion` 28.1 % (RMSNorm Pallas kernel now worth building), `collective-permute-done` 12.2 % (SPMD re-shard audit). Next: exp 37 (bf16 CE), exp 38 (sharding audit), exp 39 (RMSNorm kernel).

## [2026-04-23] ingest-batch + lint | Wave 4 follow-up — 15 concept stubs, 5 deferred codebases, 11 scaling-book chapters, lint pass

**Op**: ingest-source (11 scaling-book chapters) + ingest-codebase (5 deferred repos) + manual (15 concept stubs) + lint.

**Pages created (31)**:

- **15 concepts** (per the 2026-04-23 Pallas kernel directory's "Reusable Pallas-authoring patterns" + hardware-fact list):
  - 11 Pallas-pattern stubs: `online-softmax-with-logit-sink`, `in-kernel-dropout`, `two-level-chunk-recomputation`, `grouped-program-ids-for-l2`, `dma-overhead-heuristic`, `multi-shard-sequence-parallel-correction`, `block-sparse-offset-masks`, `custom-splash-masks`, `manual-mlir-dialect-pallas`, `pallas-on-triton-fused-gemm-activation-gemm`, `nvidia-weight-tile-bytes-limit`.
  - 3 autotune-harness stubs (from marin/levanter harness): `jaxpr-hash-cache-keys`, `compile-time-aware-autotune-filtering`, `vmem-oom-fallthrough`.
  - 1 hardware-fact concept: `vmem-budget` (v4 32 / v5e 32 / v5p 95 / **v6e 96** / **v7 48** MiB — the v6e→v7 halving).
- **5 codebases** (deferred from Wave 4's lower-priority tier):
  - `codebases/graphcast.md` (commit `08cf736`) — DeepMind weather model; splash wrapper + `WeatherMeshMask`.
  - `codebases/simply.md` (`f40b81e`) — DeepMind serving framework; DMA-overhead-bytes autotune heuristic.
  - `codebases/jaxite.md` (`e4a3351`) — Google FHE library; only non-ML Pallas TPU ref.
  - `codebases/qwix.md` (`b966dc4`) — Google quantization framework; AQT successor.
  - `codebases/aqt.md` (`9d1667e`) — deprecated; superseded by qwix.
- **11 scaling-book source pages** (one per content chapter, per-chapter summaries from a parallel Explore agent; each page ~150 lines with key claims, key data points, techniques referenced, gaps & caveats, connections). Book dated 2025-02-04; **v6e mentioned briefly, v7 absent** — explicit gaps flagged on every chapter page.

**Submodules added (5)**: `raw/code/{graphcast, simply, jaxite, qwix, aqt}`.

**Pages updated**:
- `README.md` — 5 new "Ingested codebases" entries.
- `wiki/index.md` — Codebases 21→26 (new "Wave 4 follow-up" sub-section), Sources 34→45 (new "Scaling-book chapters (11)" sub-section), Concepts 81→96 (three new sub-sections: Pallas-authoring patterns, Autotune-harness patterns, Hardware facts). Header page count 146→178.

**Key result**: Wave 4 follow-up work complete — concept-pattern stubs filed, deferred repos ingested, scaling-book finally out of "Wave 3 pending" limbo. Lint pass found and fixed 12 broken markdown links (all pre-existing in the gemma4 experiments tree — renamed experiment files with `-accepted` / `-rejected` / `-potential` suffixes whose cross-references hadn't been updated). Zero broken links remain.

**Notes**:

### Lint findings and actions taken
- **12 broken `.md` links** — all fixed. Pattern: gemma4 experiment files were renamed with outcome suffixes (`-accepted` / `-rejected` / `-potential`) after initial cross-references were written. Bulk-fixed via `sed` across five referring files. Also fixed one `../concepts/` → `../../concepts/` relative-path error in `OBSERVATIONS.md`, and one reference to a non-existent `codebases/transformers.md` (replaced with explicit upstream reference to HF transformers repo).
- **10 orphan pages** detected — all are pages created in this turn; all now indexed, no longer orphans.
- **Zero submodule-commit drift** — every codebase page's pinned commit matches its submodule checkout.
- **Zero `[!warning]` contradictions** in the wiki.
- **Hypotheses-open-14+-days lint** skipped — the gemma4 program doesn't use separate hypothesis files (it tracks them inline in the program README).
- **Experiments-without-profile-artifacts lint** skipped for this turn (not directly related to the new work).

### Scaling-book ingestion discipline
- Delegated per-chapter reading to an Explore subagent using a structured-summary schema; agent returned a 7,000-word consolidated summary that seeded the 11 source pages without requiring each chapter's full body in the main-agent context.
- **v6e (Trillium) mentioned briefly** in Ch 2; **v7 (Ironwood) absent throughout** — every chapter page flags this as a "Gaps & caveats" note because the wiki's primary gemma4 program runs on v6e-4, meaning the book's constants are already one generation behind.
- Chapter 4 KV-cache formula (`2 × S × L × K × H` bytes/sequence) and Chapter 7 critical-batch thresholds (B > 120 int8, B > 240 bf16) are the most directly-cite-able data points from the book.
- Chapter 9 "matmul roofline matched to 0.4%" worked example is now documented as an upper-bound datapoint for any "is my profile-vs-roofline gap significant?" question.

### Five deferred codebases — quick notes
- **graphcast**: non-LLM splash example; `WeatherMeshMask` is the canonical "custom splash mask" reference cited on the concept stub.
- **simply**: the DMA-overhead-bytes autotune heuristic (~0.5 MiB virtual bytes per DMA) comes from here; already concept-paged.
- **jaxite**: only non-ML Pallas TPU reference in the wiki; bf16-byte-split → u32 reassembly pattern.
- **qwix**: Google's **current** quantization framework; `QArray`-aware `pallas_call` wrapper is the right layer for future quant hypotheses.
- **aqt**: predecessor; deprecated. Do not target for new work.

### Remaining deferred / out-of-scope
- `JetStream` (AI-Hypercomputer) — **archiving 2026-02-01**; deliberate skip.
- `pytorch/xla` — consumer of tpu-inference via torch_xla custom ops; would be a framework page, not a Pallas source.
- `labyrinth-ssr` / `Essential-AI/maxtext-external` — vendor-only snapshots with no novel content.
- `pytorch/pytorch` — Inductor Pallas codegen is a compilation target, not a kernel library; deliberate skip.
- `google-deepmind/gemma` — not enumerated by the directory analysis; remains a gap.
- NVIDIA Mosaic-GPU kernels outside `jax-ml/jax` / tokamax / axlearn — not exhaustively surveyed; gap noted.

## [2026-04-23] ingest-codebase (batch) | Wave 4 — 11 Pallas-kernel repos

**Op**: ingest-codebase (batch of 11, driven by the [2026-04-23 Pallas kernel directory analysis](analyses/2026-04-23-pallas-kernel-directory.md)'s "Recommended next ingestion wave").

**Submodules added (11)**: `raw/code/{axlearn, tpu-inference, maxtext, maxdiffusion, ringattention, alphafold3, recurrentgemma, ejkernel, EasyDeL, sglang-jax, marin}`. **alphafold3 pinned to tag `v3.0.1`** (commit `231efc9`) because the ingested `gated_linear_unit/` directory was removed from `main` after that tag.

**Pages created (11 codebases)**:
- `wiki/codebases/axlearn.md` — novel SSM Pallas (Mamba1 / Mamba2-SSD / RAttention), splash extensions.
- `wiki/codebases/tpu-inference.md` — broadest novel TPU Pallas surface; crown-jewel tuning tables.
- `wiki/codebases/ringattention.md` — canonical Liu-2023 paper companion; unidirectional, no zig-zag.
- `wiki/codebases/maxtext.md` — closest public analogue of this wiki's gemma4 program.
- `wiki/codebases/maxdiffusion.md` — only repo wiring ring-attention as first-class splash-integrated kernel.
- `wiki/codebases/alphafold3.md` — only public production-grade Pallas fused GLU (GPU via Triton-on-Pallas).
- `wiki/codebases/recurrentgemma.md` — canonical LRU scan; ancestor of axlearn Mamba.
- `wiki/codebases/ejkernel.md` — broadest community TPU Pallas surface (17 kernels).
- `wiki/codebases/EasyDeL.md` — ejkernel consumer; operations-registry wrapper.
- `wiki/codebases/sglang-jax.md` — novel EAGLE speculative-decoding tree kernels + largest tuning table.
- `wiki/codebases/marin.md` — **deployment-time autotune harness** — the pattern this wiki should emulate.

**Pages updated**:
- `wiki/sources/2025-ultrascale-playbook.md` — Gaps & caveats: **partial retractions** on hypothesis candidates #2, #3, #4 based on the directory findings (ring-attention has three public refs; zig-zag still absent; RMSNorm/LayerNorm correctly unimplemented per exp 33; fused GLU reference exists at alphafold3 v3.0.1).
- `wiki/codebases/tokamax.md` — ring-attention section updated to name the three public reference impls (maxdiffusion splash-integrated, haoliuhl canonical, ejkernel splash wrapper) and reiterate that zig-zag remains open.
- `README.md` — added 11 new "Ingested codebases" entries; removed duplicate jax entry.
- `wiki/index.md` — Codebases 10→21; split into "Wave 4" (the 11 new) and "Wave 1–3" (existing). Header count 135→146.

**Key result**: Wave 4 ingestion complete — scope discipline held. The 11 new pages are shorter than average (50–180 lines each) because they intentionally defer per-kernel detail to the [pallas-kernel directory subpages](analyses/pallas-kernel-directory/) rather than re-transcribing. Every new codebase page links forward to the authoritative subpage §1–§6 row. Two partial retractions and one reaffirmation landed on the ultrascale playbook source page.

**Notes**:
- **Novelty anchors** (kernels / patterns that exist only in the newly-ingested repos):
  - axlearn: Mamba1 (`mamba_kernels.py`), Mamba2/SSD (`ssd_kernels.py`), RAttention linear attention (`linear_attention_kernels.py`), splash-with-dropout + logit-sink.
  - tpu-inference: RPA v3 (+ hd64), MLA v1/v2, fused_moe v1, quantized_matmul blockwise, all_gather_matmul, GDN + triangle_solver, SparseCore gather/scatter, structured_sparse_matmul v1.
  - alphafold3 (v3.0.1): Pallas fused GLU (GPU, `mosaic_gpu` via Triton).
  - recurrentgemma: LRU Pallas scan with complex accumulators + multi-shard correction.
  - ringattention: canonical Pallas TPU ring-attention (paper companion).
  - sglang-jax: EAGLE tree-speculative-sampling kernels + ~2,000+ RPA tuning entries (largest table surveyed).
  - marin: deployment-time kernel-agnostic autotune harness with six distinguishing properties over tokamax's write-time tuner.
- **Crown-jewel autotune patterns** (from marin's harness; all concept-candidate behaviors): compile-time-aware candidate filtering (threshold = 0.20 s), VMEM-OOM-aware fallthrough, sharding-preserving benchmark lowering, off-thread compile for mesh-bound contexts, jaxpr-hashed cache keys, GCS-aware persistent cache (shares bucket with PJRT compile cache).
- **VMEM budgets baked into kernels** (concept-level facts from tpu-inference quantized_matmul): v6 = 96 MiB, v7 = 48 MiB. RPA default = 100 MB. update_kv_cache = 64 MB. Worth elevating to concept pages.
- **NVIDIA weight-tile limit** (marin fused CE): `_NVIDIA_WEIGHT_TILE_BYTES_LIMIT = 101_376` — same on GB10 and H100. Concept fact.
- **DMA-overhead-equivalent** (simply; not ingested but referenced): ~0.5 MiB virtual bytes, assumed constant across TPU generations.
- **alphafold3 v3.0.1 pin discipline**: kernels removed from `main` after that tag. Every wiki link must include `@v3.0.1` or use the local submodule tree.
- **Deferred** (per Wave 4 proposal lower-priority tier): jaxite (niche FHE non-ML), graphcast (wrapper), simply (wrapper), qwix/aqt (quant framework), JetStream (archiving 2026-02-01), pytorch/pytorch Inductor, labyrinth-ssr / Essential-AI (vendor-only), pytorch/xla (consumer of tpu-inference via torch_xla custom ops).
- **Concept-page stubs not yet filed**: 13 reusable patterns surfaced by the directory (online-softmax-with-logit-sink, in-kernel-dropout, two-level-chunk-recomputation, grouped-program-ids-for-L2, DMA-overhead-heuristic, multi-shard-sequence-parallel-correction, block-sparse-offset-masks, jaxpr-hash-cache-keys, compile-time-aware-filtering, VMEM-OOM-fallthrough, manual-MLIR-dialect-Pallas, Pallas-on-Triton-fused-GEMM-activation-GEMM, custom-splash-masks). Candidate for a subsequent pass; not blocking.
- **Ingestion-page verbosity note**: each new page deliberately short — the per-kernel detail is authoritative in the [pallas-kernel directory subpages](analyses/pallas-kernel-directory/) (written by six parallel research agents), so codebase pages link forward rather than re-transcribe. Following SCHEMA's "One entity/concept/model per page. Split when a page exceeds ~500 lines" rule + avoiding duplication.

## [2026-04-23] analyze | Pallas kernel directory — ~200 kernels across ~30 repos

**Op**: analyze (directory/catalog; six parallel web-research agents).

**Pages created**:
- `wiki/analyses/2026-04-23-pallas-kernel-directory.md` — main directory page: cross-cutting functional-category tables (attention/paged/ring/MoE/norm/GLU/matmul/collectives/SSM/CE-loss), stability distribution, autotune/tuning-table inventory (crown jewels), reusable patterns (13 concept-page candidates), confirmed gaps, direct impact on open hypothesis candidates, recommended Wave-4 ingestion order.
- `wiki/analyses/pallas-kernel-directory/01-upstream-jax-tokamax.md` — ~55 kernels (jax-ml/jax + openxla/tokamax).
- `wiki/analyses/pallas-kernel-directory/02-ai-hypercomputer.md` — ~17 kernels (maxtext + maxdiffusion + JetStream). JetStream archives 2026-02-01.
- `wiki/analyses/pallas-kernel-directory/03-inference-engines.md` — ~33 kernels (vllm-project/tpu-inference + sglang-jax + aphrodite).
- `wiki/analyses/pallas-kernel-directory/04-research-labs.md` — ~18 kernels (apple/axlearn + google-deepmind/{recurrentgemma, simply, graphcast, alphafold3@v3.0.1}).
- `wiki/analyses/pallas-kernel-directory/05-frameworks-quant.md` — ~18 kernels (tunix, qwix, aqt, jaxite, paxml/praxis, pytorch/xla, marin/levanter, pytorch/pytorch Inductor).
- `wiki/analyses/pallas-kernel-directory/06-community-research.md` — ~50 rows (ejkernel, EasyDeL, ringattention, flashback, gla-jax, sqtian, maxtext-external, tpu-research, recompute_dont_restore + small repos).

**Pages updated**:
- `wiki/index.md` — Analyses 2 → 3 + 6 subpages under a nested list; page count 128 → 135.

**Key result**: **~200 Pallas kernels catalogued across ~30 repos**, each with source-path URL, backend, stability, performance claims (verbatim when they exist), use case, and callers. `mosaic_tpu` backend dominates (~60%). Every production-grade TPU kernel is either published upstream in jax-ml/jax / openxla/tokamax or vendored from them. Novel community kernels concentrated in six repos: **vllm-project/tpu-inference** (RPA v2/v3, MLA v1/v2, fused_moe v1, quantized_matmul blockwise, all_gather_matmul, fused_gdn, sparse_core, batched_rpa), **apple/axlearn** (Mamba1, Mamba2/SSD, RAttention linear-attention — the only public TPU-Pallas SSM kernels publicly), **AI-Hypercomputer/maxdiffusion** (ring_attention integrated with splash), **google-deepmind/alphafold3@v3.0.1** (production Pallas fused-GLU), **google-deepmind/recurrentgemma** (canonical LRU scan), **erfanzar/ejkernel** (broadest community TPU surface — 17 kernels).

**Crown-jewel tuning artifacts**: sglang-jax's ~2,000+ entry RPA `tuned_block_sizes.py`; tpu-inference's 1,200+ RPA v2 + 600+ quantized_matmul + 47 megablox + 28 fused_moe v1 tables; marin/levanter's **kernel-agnostic deployment-time autotune harness** (jaxpr-hashed keys, compile-cost-aware candidate filtering at 0.20s threshold, VMEM-OOM fallthrough, GCS-persistent cache colocated with PJRT). VMEM budgets baked into kernels: quantized_matmul v6=96 MiB, v7=48 MiB; RPA default=100 MiB; update_kv_cache=64 MiB. DMA-overhead-equivalent from simply: ~0.5 MiB virtual bytes across TPU generations.

**Notes**:
- **Partial retractions and closures of open hypothesis candidates on [sources/2025-ultrascale-playbook.md](sources/2025-ultrascale-playbook.md)**:
  - Candidate #2 ("wire tokamax `ring_attention_kernel` through `dot_product_attention`") — three public reference impls confirmed: maxdiffusion splash-integrated, haoliuhl canonical standalone, ejkernel splash wrapper. Hypothesis reduced from "open research" to "port + adapt" with three patterns to compare.
  - Candidate #3 ("Zig-Zag Ring Attention on TPU — no implementation found") — **retraction stands.** Ring Attention Pallas exists publicly (§6.4), but Zig-Zag causal-balance variant is **confirmed absent from every repo surveyed**, including the canonical haoliuhl repo (straight unidirectional ring, `below_or_on_diag` check only — not load-balanced).
  - Candidate #4 ("TPU-native Pallas kernels for gated_linear_unit and layer_norm in tokamax") — **partially retracted.** RMSNorm/LayerNorm absence from maxtext + tpu-inference + axlearn + upstream is external evidence that XLA-fusion is sufficient — **consistent with Gemma 4 exp 33's −8.1% empirical result.** Don't build RMSNorm. Fused GLU: AlphaFold3 v3.0.1 provides a production Pallas fused-GLU reference (GPU); porting to Mosaic-TPU is feasible but needs HLO-level validation that XLA isn't already fusing.
- **External validation of Gemma 4 exp 33 lesson** ("Pallas loses when XLA already fuses"): maxtext + tpu-inference + axlearn hand-write megablox, ragged-paged-attention, gather-reduce-sc, fused_moe — but **do not** hand-write RMSNorm, SwiGLU, softmax, or elementwise activations. That absence is data.
- **AlphaFold3 Pallas kernels live only on tag `v3.0.1`** — removed from `main`. Pin the tag in every URL.
- **jondeaton/ring-attention-jax-pallas** — **404 confirmed**, repo does not exist. Dropped from the catalog. User has no matching public repo per `gh api users/jondeaton/repos`.
- **Backend mislabels in community repos**: flashback, gla-jax, mamba2-jax-pallas all advertise Pallas but are Triton/Mosaic-GPU only. Only haoliuhl, ejkernel, sqtian, recompute_dont_restore, labyrinth-ssr (vendored), Essential-AI (vendored), and rdyro/moe_in_jax are actually TPU Pallas. Catalog flags each.
- **New concept-page candidates** (13 surfaced): online-softmax-with-logit-sink, in-kernel-dropout, two-level-chunk-recomputation, grouped-program-ids-for-L2, DMA-overhead-heuristic, multi-shard-sequence-parallel-correction, block-sparse-offset-masks, jaxpr-hash-cache-keys, compile-time-aware-filtering, VMEM-OOM-fallthrough, manual-MLIR-dialect-Pallas, Pallas-on-Triton-fused-GEMM-activation-GEMM, custom-splash-masks. Not filed as stubs yet — listed on the main directory page under "Reusable Pallas-authoring patterns".
- **Recommended Wave 4 ingestion order** (listed on the directory page): apple/axlearn (narrow kernel subdirs), vllm-project/tpu-inference, AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext, AI-Hypercomputer/maxdiffusion (narrow: splash_attention/ only), haoliuhl/ringattention, google-deepmind/alphafold3 @ v3.0.1 (narrow: gated_linear_unit/ only), google-deepmind/recurrentgemma, erfanzar/ejkernel + EasyDeL (paired), sgl-project/sglang-jax (narrow: speculative-decoding kernels), marin-community/marin (narrow: levanter/kernels/pallas/ + autotune harness).
- **Methodology**: six general-purpose subagents in parallel, each with identical per-kernel row schema; verified top candidates via GitHub API + WebFetch. Durations ~4–6 minutes each; total wall clock ~6 minutes for research + ~10 minutes for consolidation.
- **Gaps flagged**: NVIDIA Mosaic-GPU kernel catalog for GPU-side parity (enumerated in jax-ml/jax but not exhaustively surveyed in downstream GPU-Pallas repos); `google-deepmind/gemma` not checked; Gemini training stacks not in any surveyed public repo; Anthropic/xAI/Cohere/Character private. Ragged-Paged-Attention arXiv ID appeared as `2604.15464` in one search result (likely future-dated scrape glitch) — verify before citing.

## [2026-04-23] ingest-codebase | jax (jax-ml/jax)

**Op**: ingest-codebase.
**Pages created**:
- `wiki/codebases/jax.md` — codebase parent page for `jax-ml/jax` at commit `feb5ba0585` (HEAD on 2026-04-23; bleeding-edge pin). Scoped to perf-relevant surfaces only — the repo is far too large for exhaustive ingestion.

**Pages updated**:
- `.gitmodules` — added `raw/code/jax` submodule.
- `README.md` — added jax to "Ingested codebases" list at the top.
- `wiki/index.md` — Codebases 9→10 (jax inserted at top); header count 127→128.

**Key result**: The ground-truth JAX repo is now ingested. The codebase page focuses on the four perf-relevant surface buckets — transformations & compilation, parallelism & sharding, kernels & lowering, profiling & analysis — and indexes 12 concrete performance-relevant levers with file-path anchors. The **first-party reference TPU Pallas kernel tree** at `jax.experimental.pallas.ops.tpu.*` (splash_attention, paged_attention, ragged_paged_attention, megablox, flash_attention, matmul, all_gather, threefry) is now first-class in the wiki — previously referenced only transitively through tokamax's mirror and the 2026-04-23 pallas-kernel-source-survey analysis.

**Notes**:
- **Commit `feb5ba0585` is `HEAD` on 2026-04-23** — the most-recent possible pin when ingesting. `git submodule update --remote raw/code/jax` to bump.
- **`jax.experimental.roofline` surfaced as a first-party alternative to `pallas-forge.roofline_chart`**: works on any JAX function, not just Pallas kernels; `roofline`, `register_roofline`, `roofline_and_grad` are the public API. The [pallas-forge](codebases/pallas-forge.md) page's `roofline_chart` is duplicated functionality; the codebase page flags this.
- **`jax.experimental.compilation_cache`, `jax.experimental.layout`, `jax.lax.scan` are all named in the gemma4 ceiling analysis as remaining levers.** The jax page now gives them concrete file-path anchors. The compilation cache is "infrastructure only, no TPS" per the analysis; layout is the backing API for the SEQ_MINOR choice in exp 24; scan-over-layers Option B is one of three remaining viable paths.
- **Splash-attention upstream-vs-mirror reconciliation**: `jax/experimental/pallas/ops/tpu/splash_attention/` in this repo is the authoritative upstream for both the wiki's splash-attention concept page and the `tokamax` `_src/ops/experimental/tpu/splash_attention/` copy. Future splash-tuning hypotheses can target either entry point; the jax codebase page now says so.
- **MegaBlox (`ops/tpu/megablox/gmm.py`) is first-party for MoE grouped matmul.** The 2026-04-23 pallas-kernel-source-survey already surfaced this; the jax codebase page gives it the in-tree citation.
- **Scope discipline**: page deliberately does not enumerate every jax module — numpy, scipy, nn, random, lax primitives other than `scan`, the jax2tf / jax2onnx paths, export/AOT surfaces beyond `serialize_executable`, the CUDA/Triton GPU Pallas path beyond a pointer, and the docs/tests/benchmarks directories are all explicitly out of scope. The page's job is to index the perf-relevant knobs, not to teach JAX.
- **Two surfaces underused by this wiki so far, now documented**: `jax.experimental.source_mapper` (HLO↔Python back-reference — complements the xprof graph viewer) and `jax.experimental.custom_partitioning` (SPMD escape hatch — the mechanism production libraries use to route around partitioner gaps in ragged-paged-attention / MoE kernels per the pallas-kernel survey).
- **No hypotheses / concept stubs filed.** Concept pages for most of the JAX surfaces ([pallas-kernel](concepts/pallas-kernel.md), [scan-over-layers](concepts/scan-over-layers.md), [sharding](concepts/sharding.md), [rematerialization](concepts/rematerialization.md), [jax-trace](concepts/jax-trace.md), etc.) already exist and link both ways.

## [2026-04-23] analyze | Public Pallas kernel source survey

**Op**: analyze (web-research survey).
**Pages created**:
- `wiki/analyses/2026-04-23-pallas-kernel-source-survey.md` — categorized inventory of every public source of JAX Pallas kernel code (Tier 1 production libraries → Tier 7 marginal). Agent-delegated WebSearch + WebFetch + GitHub API; verified top candidates.

**Pages updated**:
- `wiki/index.md` — Analyses 1 → 2; header page count 126 → 127.

**Key result**: Five production-grade ingest candidates identified: **AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext** (direct trainer analogue), **vllm-project/tpu-inference** (broadest novel kernel surface: ragged-paged-attention v2/v3, MLA, gdn, sparse-core, structured-sparse-matmul), **AI-Hypercomputer/maxdiffusion** (ring-attention reference), **apple/axlearn** (Mamba/SSD + rattention), **sgl-project/sglang-jax** (simple-gla, spec-decoding).

**Notes**:
- **Partial retraction** on two open hypothesis candidates from [sources/2025-ultrascale-playbook.md](sources/2025-ultrascale-playbook.md):
  - Candidate #2 ("wire tokamax `ring_attention_kernel` through `dot_product_attention`") — public reference impl exists at `AI-Hypercomputer/maxdiffusion/src/maxdiffusion/kernels/splash_attention/ring_attention_kernel.py`. Reduces the hypothesis from "open research" to "port + adapt".
  - Candidate #3 ("Zig-Zag Ring Attention on TPU — no implementation found") — Ring Attention Pallas exists publicly in `haoliuhl/ringattention` (770⭐, canonical Liu et al. impl). Whether the specific Zig-Zag causal-balance variant is implemented remains unverified — needs code-level read.
- **Cross-reference with gemma4 exp 33 lesson** ("Pallas loses when XLA already fuses"): external evidence supports this. maxtext and tpu-inference hand-write megablox, ragged-paged-attention, gather-reduce-sc — but **do not** hand-write RMSNorm or SwiGLU. That absence is data.
- **AlphaFold3 Pallas GLU** exists at `google-deepmind/alphafold3` **tag v3.0.1** — removed from `main`. Pin the tag before referencing.
- **New category surfaced: kernel-optimization agents** — `ucb-bar/autocomp`, `primatrix/Glaucis` (evolutionary Pallas search), `aryatschand/JAXBench` (LLM-authored kernel benchmark). Direct analogues to this wiki's autoresearch mission; worth shallow reads for search-procedure priors.
- **Scope discipline**: did not file individual hypothesis pages or update the existing playbook hypothesis candidates; the analysis page cross-references them inline and leaves promotion to human adjudication.
- **Gaps flagged in the analysis** for a follow-up sweep: NVIDIA Mosaic-GPU ops inside `jax-ml/jax`, GoogleCloudPlatform sample repos, `google-deepmind/gemma`, private-org repos (Anthropic, xAI, Cohere, Character), Ragged-Paged-Attention arXiv ID verification, `jondeaton/ring-attention-jax-pallas` 404 on verification.

## [2026-04-23] ingest-codebase + ingest-source | pallas-forge + Karpathy LLM-wiki backfill

**Op**: ingest-codebase (pallas-forge) + ingest-source (Karpathy LLM-wiki).
**Pages created**:
- `wiki/codebases/pallas-forge.md` — codebase parent page for `linhkid/pallas-forge` at commit `090510b7`. Already used (and found wanting) in gemma4 exp 20; the page makes that context first-class and captures the methodological lessons (isolated-microbench vs in-graph, no-custom_vjp blocker, v5e-only numbers, canonical 3D-grid matmul template).
- `wiki/sources/2026-karpathy-llm-wiki.md` — source page for Karpathy's "LLM Wiki" idea file, the methodological ancestor of this wiki's `SCHEMA.md`. Already locally saved as `raw/sources/2026-karpathy-llm-wiki.md`; backfilling the wiki-side page makes the design lineage explicit.

**Pages updated**:
- `wiki/index.md` — Codebases 8→9 (added pallas-forge at top of list); Sources 33→34 (new "Methodology (1)" subsection); header count bumped to 126 pages.

**Key result**: Two ingestion gaps closed. The pallas-forge page consolidates what the gemma4 program has already learned about the library (exp 20 + exp 33) rather than letting it sit only in experiment pages; the Karpathy-wiki source page documents where this wiki's operating protocol comes from, which matters for future schema edits.

**Notes**:
- **pallas-forge status recap (as captured on the codebase page)**: 3 reference kernels, tuner, roofline, XProf-trace integration — *but* forward-only (no `jax.custom_vjp`), so any training hypothesis that swaps a pallas-forge kernel into a module's `forward` crashes at `jax.value_and_grad` ("Linearization failed to produce known values"). Gemma4 exp 20 is the direct confirmation. Alternative for kernel swaps in training: [tokamax](codebases/tokamax.md) (exposes autodiff-capable `rms_norm` / `layer_norm` / splash-attention paths).
- **Generalizable lesson already in the wiki, now cross-linked**: from the 2026-04-23 Gemma 4 optimization-ceiling analysis (exp 33) — *"Pallas kernels are a net win only when XLA wasn't already exploiting the pattern via fusion"*. pallas-forge's v5e README numbers (3.44× RMSNorm isolated-microbench) do not predict in-graph wins on v6e-4; exp 33 showed an 8.1% regression. The codebase page flags this explicitly under "Performance-relevant surfaces §3 Isolated-microbench ≠ in-graph gain".
- **pallas-forge `TPU_SPECS` gap**: the hardware-preset table for `roofline_chart` covers v4/v5e/v5p only; no v6e entry. Anyone running `roofline_chart` on v6e must supply peak-TFLOPS and peak-HBM-bandwidth directly.
- **Karpathy-wiki source is methodology, not TPU-perf content**: ingested to make the schema's lineage traceable; no hypotheses generated. Its "Connections" section explicitly maps the source's pattern to this wiki's `SCHEMA.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `index.md` / `log.md` implementations.
- **Ingestion-audit findings recorded for completeness**: (1) the `notes.md` TODO `using git submodule add https://github.com/linhkid/pallas-forge under raw/code, update readme` was already satisfied (`.gitmodules` entry exists, `raw/code/pallas-forge/` is checked out at commit `090510b`); the only missing piece was the wiki page, now filed. (2) `raw/sources/2026-karpathy-llm-wiki.md` was on disk but had no wiki counterpart, now filed. (3) No other unprocessed raw sources or un-documented submodules found.
- **Out of scope for this ingestion** (per `notes.md` lines 28–37, the gemma-4-E4B import + torchax trainer work): that is implementation, not ingestion; the Gemma 4 program already has its own `experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/` tree with 33 experiments completed and a ceiling analysis filed. Not touched.

## [2026-04-23] analyze | Gemma 4 E4B on v6e-4 — optimization ceiling reached at exp 25

**Op**: analyze (session ceiling synthesis).

**Pages created**:
- [`wiki/analyses/2026-04-23-gemma4-v6e4-optimization-ceiling.md`](analyses/2026-04-23-gemma4-v6e4-optimization-ceiling.md) — synthesis of the 33-experiment loop. Documents the trajectory (baseline 30,570 → exp 25 33,372, +9.2%), what worked vs what didn't, the step-time decomposition at exp 25, the Pallas-fuses-into-matmul lesson from exp 33, and what would actually move the needle next (hardware scale-up, scan-over-layers Option B, or accepting ceiling).

**Pages updated**:
- `wiki/index.md` — Analyses section populated.

**Key result**: Optimization loop has reached diminishing returns on this hardware/model combo. Trunk stays at exp 25 (33,372 TPS, seq=1024 batch=3 fsdp=4 bf16, splash_pallas + SEQ_MINOR + block=1024 + fused_bwd + bf16 CE + selective remat). Eight experiments since exp 25 (exp 26–33) produced zero further wins: scan-over-layers blocked (5 Gemma-specific issues), tokamax DPA blocked (mosaic_tpu no sliding-window), 2D mesh 2.4× slower at this chip count, Pallas RMSNorm −8.1% due to XLA already fusing it with neighbor matmuls, long-seq and XLA-flag-isolation experiments neutral or dominated.

**Notes**:
- **Generalizable lesson (exp 33)**: Pallas kernels are a net win only when XLA wasn't already exploiting the pattern via fusion. Splash won (exp 8) because XLA can't express online-softmax. RMSNorm loses because XLA already fuses it. Likely Pallas SwiGLU would too — don't build it.
- **Remaining viable paths** (none attempted here): (a) 300-500 LOC scan-over-layers Option B for compile-time compression, (b) hardware scale-up to v6e-8 or v5p-4 where 2D mesh and collective overlap become economic, (c) persistent compile cache (infrastructure only, no TPS).
- **Exp 28 kept but not merged**: +0.9% at seq=2048 b=1 strictly dominated by exp 25's higher-batch throughput. Preserved for long-seq reference.

## [2026-04-23] protocol + experiments | Gemma 4 E4B program — program.md formalization + exp2 crash

**Op**: manual (protocol formalization) + run-experiment (exp2, crashed).
**Pages created**:
- `wiki/experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/program.md` — the agent-facing protocol for this program, adapted from the sibling-wiki TorchTitan autoresearch template but specialized to Gemma 4 E4B / torchax / v6e-4.
- `wiki/experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/RESULTS.tsv` — tab-separated ledger (gitignored via `wiki/experiments/*/RESULTS.tsv`).
- `wiki/experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/OBSERVATIONS.md` — skim-and-reason aggregation log; backfilled with baseline + exp1 + exp2 blocks.
- `wiki/experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/2026-04-23-exp2-pin-out-shardings-rejected.md` — Exp 2 experiment page (crashed/invalid, reverted).

**Pages updated**:
- Program `README.md` — stripped the in-README "Optimization loop procedure" section; replaced with a short "How to start the optimization loop" pointer to `program.md`. History extended for exp2 + the protocol formalization.

**Key result**: **Exp 2 CRASHED** pre-trace with `ValueError: Received incompatible devices` on `weights['lm_head.weight']`. Attempt to pin `out_shardings=(loss_ns, weights_ns, opt_state_ns)` on `jax.jit` to fix the ~150 s step-1 recompile hit a tied-weight-dedup plumbing issue in torchax's `JittableModule` — the tied `lm_head.weight` ↔ `embed_tokens.weight` emits an `out_shardings` leaf whose device list collapses to `[0]` even though the input sharding is full-mesh `[0, 1, 3, 2]`. Reverted the `train.py` change; step-1 recompile remains open. Hypothesis marked `verdict: invalid` (pre-trace crash, nothing measured) — still viable under a different implementation (`dedup_parameters=False` + manual tying, or `with_sharding_constraint` inside the train step).

**Notes**:
- **Protocol formalization**: Karpathy-autoresearch-style discipline now lives in a dedicated `program.md` that defines the fixed bindings (hardware, conda env, trainer path, baseline command, libtpu version, profile/HLO conventions, xprof_mcp server), the architectural invariants (can/cannot-change tables for Gemma 4), the measurement protocol (TPS primary, MFU secondary, median steps 6–15), the ledger + observations schema, the full experiment loop, and accumulated heuristics. Future experiments start from reading `program.md` and tail-ing `OBSERVATIONS.md` / `RESULTS.tsv`.
- **Retroactive backfill**: baseline + exp1 + exp2 are transcribed into `RESULTS.tsv` and `OBSERVATIONS.md` for continuity — these experiments predate the formal protocol but provide the foundation the protocol was written against.
- **libtpu is at 0.0.40, the latest** (verified across PyPI, `libtpu-lts-releases`, `libtpu-nightly-releases`). The exp1 "unknown flag" failure was a name error (real name is `--xla_tpu_overlap_compute_collective_tc`, not `_comms`), not a version issue. Documented the symbol-dump-as-source-of-truth trick in `program.md` heuristics.
- **Discovered gotcha**: tied `lm_head` ↔ `embed_tokens` + torchax `JittableModule.dedup_parameters=True` + HF `load_state_dict(assign=True)` interact in a way that confuses `out_shardings` construction. Logged as a `program.md` heuristic; a future experiment can route around it via `dedup_parameters=False`.
- Step-1 recompile mitigation deferred; next experiment focuses on a structural memory-saving change (per the memory-ceiling rule — baseline hit 95% HBM).

## [2026-04-23] experiment | Gemma 4 E4B — Exp 1: async-collective XLA flags (REFUTED)

**Op**: run-experiment (first optimization-loop cycle on the Gemma 4 program).
**Pages created**: `wiki/experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/2026-04-23-exp1-async-collective-flags-rejected.md`.
**Pages updated**: program `README.md` history (baseline-seq-1024 + Exp 1).
**Raw artifacts**: `raw/profiles/2026-04-23-gemma4-loss-confirm/` (20-step seq=1024 baseline, clean loss), `raw/profiles/2026-04-23-gemma4-exp1-async-collectives/` (exp1 trace). Both symlinked into the live xprof instance as `gemma4_baseline_seq1024_20260423` and `gemma4_exp1_async_collectives_20260423`.

**Key result**: **Hypothesis REFUTED.** Enabling `--xla_tpu_enable_latency_hiding_scheduler` + `--xla_tpu_enable_async_collective_fusion` (+ `fuse_all_gather`, `multiple_steps`) via `LIBTPU_INIT_ARGS` regressed steady-state step time **134.4 → 168.3 ms (+25 %)** at seq=1024, batch=1, FSDP=4, v6e-4. Collectives got faster (all-gather −5 ms, all-reduce-scatter −9 ms) but compute-fusion memory traffic blew up (convolution fusion +2.5× bytes, loop fusion +1.9×). Scheduler gained freedom to reorder; it fused collectives but broke compute-order locality. Loss trajectory preserved (bf16-reorder noise only).

**Notes**:
- 20-step loss-descent confirmation (pre-experiment): loss 3.93 → 1.97 over 20 steps at seq=1024; step time stable at 134.4 ± 0.5 ms. Confirms the baseline scaffold is training correctly.
- Ran full autoresearch loop: baseline profile → hypothesis pick (#9) → experiment → profile diff → verdict → file page → pick next hypothesis. First complete cycle on this program.
- **Flag-placement gotcha**: `--xla_tpu_*` flags go in `LIBTPU_INIT_ARGS`, **not** `XLA_FLAGS`. First attempt bombed with `parse_flags_from_env.cc:234 Unknown flags in XLA_FLAGS`. Logged for future experiments — hypothesis-writers should not trust the "XLA flag" name.
- **Libtpu 0.0.40 does not know `--xla_tpu_overlap_compute_collective_comms`.** Dropped before the successful run. Good instance of a flag catalog drifting vs. the installed runtime.
- **xprof-mcp tools used in the loop**: `list_runs`, `get_overview`, `get_top_hlo_ops`, `get_op_profile`, `get_memory_profile`, `get_device_information`. The HLO-op-level before/after diff was the decisive evidence for "refuted" — wall-clock alone would have been ambiguous, but the bytes-accessed explosion made the mechanism clear.
- Hypothesis parked, not retired — at larger effective batch (via remat or NaN-fix at seq=2048) the collective-overlap win may swamp the compute-locality loss. Revisit after hypothesis #6.
- Next natural hypothesis: **fix the step-1 recompile** (explicit `in_shardings` / `out_shardings` on `jax.jit`) — saves ~150 s per experiment run, pure iteration-speed win. Then **#6 selective remat**.

## [2026-04-22] experiment | Gemma 4 E4B baseline (v6e-4, FSDP)

**Op**: run-experiment (baseline infrastructure check)
**Pages created**: `wiki/experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/2026-04-22-baseline.md`.
**Pages updated**: program `README.md` (History section updated with first baseline numbers); `wiki/experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/torchax/{train.py,model/sharding.py,requirements.txt}` (8 targeted fixes to get the scaffold to actually run — enumerated on the baseline page).
**Raw artifacts**: `raw/profiles/2026-04-22-gemma4-baseline/` — xprof trace, steps 5–7 at seq=2048.

**Key result**: First working run. Steady-state **249 ms/step at seq=2048, batch=1, FSDP=4 → ~33k tokens/sec, ~26% MFU** (corrected from an initial `6PT` overestimate of 44% — `P=8B` double-counts Gemma 4's Per-Layer-Embedding lookup tables, which don't participate in matmul FLOPs). Seq-length sweep: **13% MFU @ seq=512, 23% @ seq=1024, 26% @ seq=2048**. Verdict: **supported** on the infrastructure-check hypothesis; **NOT a quality-valid baseline at seq=2048** until the NaN loss is fixed.

**Notes**:
- Hardware was **v6e-4**, not the v6e-8 the scaffold README assumed. FSDP default auto-picked fsdp=4 from `jax.device_count()` — no config change needed.
- **Default sharding strategy flipped TP=8 → FSDP** per user directive. Both paths now available; FSDP is the default. FSDP sharding rule: every ≥2D param shards on its largest dim divisible by `fsdp_size` over a 1D `'fsdp'` axis.
- **Python 3.13.13** env (`gemma4_py313`) works with jax 0.10.0, torch 2.11.0+cpu, torchax 0.0.12 (editable install from the wiki submodule), transformers 5.7.0.dev0 (Gemma 4 only on main), datasets, optax, accelerate.
- **8 scaffold fixes** applied to get from written-but-untested to running; all enumerated in the baseline page's "Scaffold changes applied" table. Most consequential:
  1. `interop._jax_view` → `interop.jax_view` (pytree-map variant; single-value left torch tensors unconverted).
  2. Load `Gemma4ForConditionalGeneration` (not `Gemma4ForCausalLM`) — HF checkpoint is multimodal-only and `ForCausalLM` silently re-inits every weight (name-prefix mismatch against `model.language_model.*`).
  3. Monkey-patch `model.forward` with a text-only path (bypass the multimodal orchestrator's `input_ids[mask] = pad` which is not JIT-traceable).
  4. Apply `final_logit_softcapping=30.0` in the text-only forward (did not fix the seq=2048 NaN, but is semantically required).
  5. Requirements.txt pointed torchax at `pytorch/xla` subdirectory; actual repo is `google/torchax`. Switched to an editable install from the wiki's own submodule (commit `8f957d1`).
- **Correctness issues found by the baseline** (flagged for the next experiment):
  - **NaN loss at seq≥2048** — loss is clean at seq∈{512, 1024}. Likely bf16 attention overflow or a Gemma 4 hybrid-attention mask edge case. Prerequisite for any seq=2048 perf work.
  - **OOM at batch=4, seq=2048** — attention N×N materialized (no flash/splash). Directly motivates hypothesis #1 (Splash Attention).
  - **Step 1 recompiles** — both step 0 and step 1 take ~155 s, step 2+ hits the cache. Likely a sharding-spec / donation mismatch on step-1 inputs. Low-effort follow-up: pass explicit `in_shardings` to `jax.jit`.
- **Arithmetic error noted publicly**: initial MFU claim of 44% was wrong — used `6PT` with `P = headline 8B` instead of `P ≈ non-embedding-matmul params`. Gemma 4's "E4B" headline includes PLE lookups which add params but no matmul FLOPs. User caught this; corrected to ~26% MFU via detailed per-matmul FLOP counting. Keep this in mind for future model-size-related FLOP estimates.
- **Compile time dominates** for short runs: 2 × ~155 s compile vs 2.5 s of useful work at seq=2048 × 8 steady-state steps. Hypothesis #7 (scan-over-layers) should collapse this.

## [2026-04-22] scaffold | Gemma 4 E4B torchax trainer (untested)

**Op**: manual (scaffold code for first execution path of an optimization program)
**Pages created**: 9 files under `wiki/experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/torchax/` (1,215 lines total):
- `train.py` (439 lines) — fine-tune trainer with profile-step capture.
- `model/sharding.py` (245 lines) — 2D `(dp, tp)` mesh + NeMo-Megatron sharding adapted for Gemma 4 GQA.
- `model/README.md` (118 lines) — config + sharding assumptions, upstream source of truth.
- `data.py` (118 lines) — wikitext loader + fixed-length packer.
- `README.md` (134 lines, includes augmented "Running the trainer" section) — runbook.
- `model/__init__.py` (46 lines) — re-exports `Gemma4Config`, `Gemma4ForCausalLM`, `Gemma4ForConditionalGeneration`, `Gemma4Model` from `transformers`.
- `run.sh` (50 lines) — wrapper setting `XLA_FLAGS` + `LIBTPU_INIT_ARGS`, forwards to `train.py`.
- `config.yaml` (22 lines) — default args.
- `requirements.txt` (43 lines) — deps pinned against torchax commit `8f957d1`.

**Pages updated**: none (wiki markdown was already in place; only trainer code added).

**Key result**: First execution path of the Gemma 4 program is scaffolded. Status marked **UNTESTED** in multiple places — scaffold written from ingested source pages (jax-huggingface part 2 sharding recipe, torchax codebase architecture, xprof capture docs) without running a single step.

**Research findings worth capturing as wiki content later (not yet pages)**:
- **Gemma 4 E4B is public Apache-2.0**, not gated (login still required for HF hub). `config.json` readable at `https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-4-E4B/raw/main/config.json`.
- **Architecture specifics**: 42 layers, hidden=2560, `num_attention_heads=8`, `num_key_value_heads=2`, `head_dim=256`, `intermediate_size=10240`, vocab=262144, sliding_window=512, max_position=131072. "E4B" = effective-4B via Per-Layer Embeddings; **~8B with embeddings**.
- **Novelties vs Gemma 3**: hybrid attention (local SW 512 + global), `num_kv_shared_layers=18` (cross-layer KV sharing), `rope_type=proportional` with `partial_rotary_factor=0.25` on full-attention layers, `final_logit_softcapping=30.0`, `gelu_pytorch_tanh` MLP, `tie_word_embeddings=true`.
- **Multimodal**: E4B ships vision + audio branches. Trainer targets text-only (`Gemma4ForCausalLM` with fallback to `Gemma4ForConditionalGeneration`).
- **Sharding corner case**: `num_kv_heads=2` does NOT divide `tp=8`. Default partitioning therefore **replicates K/V projections** rather than silently dropping parallelism — flagged as a future hypothesis.
- **Canonical class names** (per HF `transformers` main, `transformers_version: 5.5.0.dev0`): `Gemma4Config`, `Gemma4ForCausalLM`, `Gemma4ForConditionalGeneration`, `Gemma4Model`. Transformers ships Gemma 4 in `src/transformers/models/gemma4/`.
- **DeepMind gemma repo** exposes `gm.nn.Gemma4_E4B()` + `gm.ckpts.CheckpointPath.GEMMA4_E4B_IT` — native-JAX reference for the `../jax/` folder when that path is activated.

**Assumptions flagged for baseline-run verification**:
1. `Gemma4ForCausalLM` import works; falls back to `ForConditionalGeneration` if not.
2. HF state-dict key naming matches Gemma-family convention (`q_proj`, `k_proj`, …, `embed_tokens`) — regex-based sharder in `sharding.py` is fragile and should be verified with `print(list(model.state_dict())[:20])`.
3. `num_kv_shared_layers=18` may surface as extra/renamed params not covered by the regex — they default to replicated (conservative).
4. torchax API at commit `8f957d1` matches the calls in `train.py` (`JittableModule`, `interop.jax_view/torch_view`, `enable_performance_mode`, `apply_jax_`, `save_checkpoint`).
5. `wikitext-2-raw-v1` chosen as default (small, fast smoke-test). `wikitext-103-raw-v1` available via flag.
6. HF pytree registration targets `CausalLMOutputWithPast` + `DynamicCache`; `StaticCache` registration deferred to a future decode hypothesis.
7. `final_logit_softcapping=30.0` assumed to be implemented inside HF's forward (Gemma 2/3 precedent).

**Known gaps in the scaffold**:
- `--grad_accum` is parsed but not threaded through the training loop.
- No `with_sharding_constraint` activation annotations inside the forward (relies on GSPMD propagation from weight shardings).
- No checkpoint *load* path — `--checkpoint_dir` only saves.
- Splash-attention swap (program hypothesis #1) not wired yet.
- Optimizer states inherit gradient dtype (bf16 if forward is bf16); no explicit fp32 promotion — a baseline concern.

**Next steps for the human** (runbook):
1. `pip install -r wiki/experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/torchax/requirements.txt` on a v6e-8 host.
2. `huggingface-cli login` with a token that's accepted the Gemma license.
3. `bash wiki/experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/torchax/run.sh --steps 5 --profile_steps 3`.
4. File the baseline numbers into `wiki/experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/<YYYY-MM-DD>-baseline.md` (the first dated experiment page).

## [2026-04-22] file-program | Gemma 4 E4B — TPU autoresearch optimization

**Op**: manual (file a new optimization program)
**Pages created**: `wiki/experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/README.md` — program page for `google/gemma-4-E4B` on TPU v6e via torchax.
**Pages updated**: `wiki/index.md` — Models section (0 → 1).

**Key result**: First `model/` analogue filed. 16 open hypotheses consolidated from Wave 1/2 findings, the xprof-mcp TPU_OPTIMIZATION guide, and the Ultra-Scale Playbook — now have a place to attach. Baseline not yet captured; hypothesis #0 in the ranked list is "capture baseline profile."

**Notes**:
- **Intentional schema deviation**: SCHEMA.md specifies `wiki/models/<slug>.md` for model-under-optimization pages and `wiki/experiments/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md` (flat) for experiments. This program uses a **nested folder** `wiki/experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/` that co-locates the program README (functions as the model page), the dated experiment files (schema-conformant names inside the folder), and optionally local scripts/code. Rationale: a long-running optimization program generates many related files and benefits from being namespaced together; the flat experiments/ directory would make it hard to find "everything about Gemma 4" vs. "everything about the next model."
- This deviation is the **second** intentional one in the wiki (first was the `autoresearch` codebase page's reframed "Structural surfaces we borrow" H2). If it works, the next SCHEMA.md edit should codify `wiki/experiments/<program-slug>/` as a permitted layout for multi-experiment programs, with the README.md inside doubling as the `model` page.
- **Code location decision (2026-04-22)**: option (b) — inside the program folder — selected by human. Further refined: **split into two sibling subfolders by execution path** rather than one `code/` folder:
  - `wiki/experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/torchax/` — primary, Gemma 4 via torchax.
  - `wiki/experiments/gemma4_autoresearch_optimization/jax/` — secondary, native-JAX port (port-equivalence discipline required: must reproduce torchax-baseline outputs within bf16 tolerance before perf numbers count).
  Each subfolder has its own README documenting conventions (dated copies for divergent scripts, relative-path references from experiment pages, binaries go to `raw/profiles/`, not these folders). The program's top-level README links both. Next SCHEMA.md update should codify `wiki/experiments/<program-slug>/` folders with execution-path-named subfolders for code as a permitted layout.
- Hypotheses are listed on the program page but **not filed as `wiki/hypotheses/*.md` individually** — the program page serves as the consolidated ranked list. Once individual hypotheses become in-flight experiments, each will be promoted to `wiki/hypotheses/<slug>.md` per schema.
- **Gemma 4 E4B**: user confirmed the identifier is correct (per https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-4-E4B). Claude's training cutoff predates this model's release; treating it as a black-box target with Gemma-family architecture (GQA, SwiGLU, RMSNorm) until the baseline ingest confirms exact config.

## [2026-04-22] lint | link hygiene + cross-link + 4 missing stubs

**Op**: lint (automated pass, 2 parallel subagents + main-thread checks)
**Pages created**: `wiki/concepts/{hbm-bandwidth,ridge-point,reduce-scatter,trace-me}.md` (4 stubs).
**Pages updated**:
- `wiki/codebases/tokamax.md` — 2 broken links fixed (`../scaling-book.md` / `../stablehlo.md` → `./scaling-book.md` / `./stablehlo.md`).
- `wiki/codebases/xprof.md` — 5 broken links fixed (missing `2026-` year prefix on xprof source slugs; also dropped stale `(stub — fill once source pages land)` annotations now that the targets exist).
- `wiki/concepts/{mark-step-sync,tensor-parallelism,sharding,ici,collective-communication,all-reduce,kv-cache,static-cache,jax-trace,decode-profile-signature,dcn,attention-block-sizes}.md` — 12 stubs had jax-huggingface and/or ultrascale-playbook sources added to their `## Sources` section.
- `wiki/index.md` — totals (77→81 concepts, 118→122 pages); Performance metrics & roofline (11→13), Parallelism & collectives (11→12), Profiling (10→11).

**Key result**: All broken markdown links in wiki/ eliminated. 0 orphan pages. Wave-2 ↔ human-ingest cross-link asymmetry closed for the known-relevant concept stubs.

**Notes**:
- **Broken-link residue**: 10 intentional placeholder links in `SCHEMA.md` itself (e.g., `../sources/2022-flash-attention.md`, `relative/path.md`, index-template `<slug>` placeholders). Left as-is — they are documentation examples.
- **Orphans**: 0 under `wiki/sources/` and `wiki/concepts/`. Codebase pages are expected to be lightly-linked (mostly from `index.md` and a few sources) and were not scanned as orphan candidates.
- **Unlinked-mention candidates reported but NOT auto-fixed** (judgment required): top 20 opportunities to wrap concept names in prose as markdown links. The main offenders (by raw mention count in prose without a link) are `megascale` (24× in megascale-viewer source), `hbm` (19× in TPU_OPTIMIZATION), `ici` (16× in TPU_OPTIMIZATION), `splash-attention` (12× in its own source page — expected), and `hlo` (12× in hlo-op-stats). Most of these are "first-mention" linking candidates rather than blanket-wrap-every-mention — deferred to per-page editing rather than bulk automation.
- **Cross-link held-backs** (content-unjustified, flagged for future reconsideration):
  - `jax-huggingface-part-1` → `xla-flags` or `hlo-dumping-and-diffing`: source does not discuss either.
  - `jax-huggingface-part-4` → `custom-trace-annotations`: hardware is A100 GPU and the source only mentions profiling as a gap.
  - `ultrascale-playbook` → `int8-quantization`: playbook covers FP8 (DeepSeek tile-scaled), not int8/AQT. Concept mismatch.
- **Submodule commit freshness**: all 8 codebase pages' `commit:` frontmatter matches current `git submodule status`. No drift.
- **Frontmatter `sources:` field**: all 81 concept stubs consistently carry `sources: N`. Schema doesn't require it, but the vault convention is now established and consistent — no reconciliation needed. If desired, a future edit to `SCHEMA.md` could codify the convention.

## [2026-04-22] ingest-source | Ultra-Scale Playbook (Tazi et al., HF, 2025-02-19)

**Op**: ingest-source
**Pages created**:
- `wiki/sources/2025-ultrascale-playbook.md` (primary source page — **first non-2026 slug**: playbook is dated Feb 2025).
- `wiki/concepts/{ring-attention,context-parallelism,sequence-parallelism,pipeline-parallelism,expert-parallelism}.md` — 5 stubs for parallelism concepts not present after Wave 2.

**Pages updated**:
- `wiki/concepts/{rematerialization,flash-attention,splash-attention,fsdp,tensor-parallelism,sharding,async-collectives,dtype-strategy}.md` — appended the new source to `## Sources` with a one-line GPU↔TPU claim.
- `wiki/codebases/{tokamax,torchax,scaling-book,autoresearch}.md` — appended the source under `## Sources` with a per-codebase connection note.
- `wiki/index.md` — added the source under Sources and the 5 new stubs under Concepts.

**Raw artifacts**:
- `raw/sources/2025-ultrascale-playbook.html` (788 KB full HTML capture of the static asset URL).
- `raw/assets/ultrascale-playbook/` — **90 figures, 5.2 MB**. Every `<img>` referenced by the playbook, downloaded from `nanotron-ultrascale-playbook.static.hf.space`. Referenced inline in the source page; the full inventory is tabulated at the bottom of that page.

**Key result**: —

**Notes**:
- Emphasis directed by human: **GPU/PyTorch ↔ TPU/JAX differences in scaling/optimization mechanics**. The source page's centrepiece is a 20-row translation matrix ("Axis | GPU/PyTorch (playbook) | TPU / JAX / XLA | Tuning surface that actually matters on TPU"). Every playbook claim in the Key-claims table is annotated with "Transfers to TPU?" and, where not, the TPU delta.
- GPU-specific sections explicitly flagged as **not transferring**: Section 10 (memory coalescing, tiling, thread coarsening, control divergence, `torch.compile`+Triton) — different programming model; Pallas Mosaic-TPU is our analogue with its own tuning vocabulary.
- The HF Space URL is dynamically rendered; `WebFetch` on the public URL returned a loading shell. The static-asset URL (`nanotron-ultrascale-playbook.static.hf.space/index.html`) served the complete document and all figures.
- **6 hypothesis candidates** surfaced but **not filed** as `hypotheses/*.md` — schema requires a `model:` slug; no model page exists yet. Listed on the source page under `## Gaps & caveats`, to be promoted when the first model page is filed:
  1. Selective activation recomputation via `jax.checkpoint_policies` (Korthikanti 70% / 2.7% claim).
  2. Wire tokamax `ring_attention_kernel` through `dot_product_attention` dispatch (kernel exists, API gap only — Wave 1 finding + this source confirms it).
  3. Zig-Zag Ring Attention on TPU — no implementation found in any ingested codebase; open algorithmic port from Brandon et al. 2023.
  4. TPU-native Pallas kernels for `gated_linear_unit` and `layer_norm` in tokamax — Wave 1 finding that these fall back to XLA reference; this source quantifies the upside category (fused kernels pay off on memory-bound ops).
  5. DeepSeek-V3 tile-scaled FP8 (1×128 activations, 128×128 weights+scales) on v6e MXU.
  6. Expose tokamax splash-attention **backward** block sizes to the autotuner — Wave 1 hidden-tuning-surface finding cross-referenced.
- Concept-page convention in the vault includes a `sources: N` frontmatter integer alongside the `## Sources` H2 section. SCHEMA.md prescribes only the section. My 5 new stubs follow the vault convention (both). Noting the coexistence; not reconciling here.
- Index entry for this source is added alongside the existing Wave 2 rebuild; Concepts section in the index now lists my 5 new stubs explicitly.

## [2026-04-22] ingest-source + stub | Wave 2 — profiling & optimization docs

**Op**: ingest-source (batch) + stub (concept stubs)
**Pages created**: 28 source pages + 72 concept stubs.
- Sources: `wiki/sources/2026-xprof-mcp-tpu-optimization.md`; xprof docs `2026-xprof-{overview-page,trace-viewer,memory-profile,memory-viewer,graph-viewer,utilization-viewer,terminology,hlo-op-stats,hlo-op-profile,framework-op-stats,perf-counters,custom-call-profiling,capturing-profiles,jax-profiling,pytorch-xla-profiling,tensorflow-profiling,docker-deployment,kubernetes-deployment,roofline-model,megascale-stats,megascale-viewer,megascale-viewer-sql}.md`; tokamax docs `2026-tokamax-{supported-ops,basic-usage,splash-attention,autotuning,benchmarking}.md`.
- Concepts: 72 stubs under `wiki/concepts/` grouped as Architecture & hardware (12), Performance metrics & roofline (11), Compiler & HLO (12), Kernels (8), Optimization techniques (7), Parallelism & collectives (7), Inference (5), Profiling (10).
**Pages updated**: `wiki/index.md` (Sources/Codebases/Concepts sections rebuilt; merged with the concurrent `jax-huggingface` ingest).
**Key result**: ~3,475 lines of source content + 72 concept stubs. Wiki now has a working vocabulary — hypothesis candidates can be stated in terms of existing concepts with citations.
**Notes**:
- Six subagents ran in parallel for source ingestion (one per content group); a seventh consolidated concept stubs from their deduplicated recommendations.
- Subagent reports surfaced additional hypothesis candidates beyond Wave 1 findings (not yet filed):
  - **xprof-mcp TPU_OPTIMIZATION**: per-matmul fp32 cast ~17% overhead; int8 shifts v5e critical batch 240→~120→~240; Llama-2-7B decode 8.8× from static-cache; flash attention saves ~32 MB/layer/request at N=4096; selective AC ~+2.7% compute for ~70% activation memory. Most claims are v5e-anchored — generalization to v6e is not pinned down in the source.
  - **tokamax-supported-ops**: `docs/supported_ops.md` lists `dot_product_attention` as GPU-only, but the code ships a TPU Pallas/Mosaic backend — doc is stale. Flagged on the source page.
  - **tokamax-splash-attention / autotuning**: raw docs are 2–3 line stubs; source pages were written from code + basic-usage doc. The autotune backward-pass block-size coverage gap (Wave 1) is now cross-linked from `autotuning.md` and `attention-block-sizes.md`.
  - **xprof-roofline**: the "bytes accessed" definition in arithmetic intensity isn't scoped to a memory tier in the doc; peak FLOPs / bandwidth per TPU generation are pulled from Device Information at runtime and not listed.
  - **xprof-megascale**: `megascale_viewer_sql` has a minor inconsistency between `pt.name` vs `ppt.name` as `device` column across the two example queries — could mislabel rows.
  - **xprof-perf-counters**: doc lists filters/columns but not individual counter semantics — deeper docs/source needed before counter-level hypotheses.
  - **xprof-hlo-op-profile** "wasted time" sort is computed against FLOPs utilization only; will underweight memory-bound ops.
- Concept stubs: 72 created; subagent flagged 4 more worth adding in a follow-up (`hbm-bandwidth`, `ridge-point`, `reduce-scatter`, `trace-me`/TraceMe). Deferred — will add if Wave 3 scaling-book references them in depth.
- No broken markdown links introduced: grep confirmed `reduce-scatter` only appears as prose in `fsdp.md` / `collective-communication.md`, not as a link.
- No schema deviations this wave.
- Concurrency note: the `jax-huggingface` codebase + 4 source pages were ingested by the human (next log entry) while Wave 2 subagents were running; index.md was merged to reflect both. Wave 2 subagents did not see or cross-link to the jax-huggingface pages; Wave 3 (scaling-book) or a dedicated LINT pass should add cross-links from `jax-huggingface-part-{2,3}.md` into the new concept stubs (sharding, tensor-parallelism, static-cache, kv-cache, splash-attention, etc.).

## [2026-04-22] ingest-codebase + ingest-source | jax-huggingface (learning_machine subfolder)

**Op**: ingest-codebase + ingest-source (combined, user-directed option B)
**Pages created**: wiki/codebases/jax-huggingface.md; wiki/sources/2026-jax-huggingface-part-{1,2,3,4}.md
**Pages updated**: wiki/index.md; .gitmodules (added `raw/code/learning-machine` submodule, commit `93328b2`)
**Key result**: 5 pages written. Ingestion scoped to `jax-huggingface/` subfolder of `qihqi/learning_machine`; sibling subprojects (llama_ref, spmd_sharding, torch_pallas, flash_attn_speed, jax_perf, etc.) deferred. First `source/` pages in the wiki — exercised the source template alongside the codebase template.
**Notes**:
- Per-post data points captured in source-page tables: Part 1 v6e 1-chip Llama-2-7B forward 4.37s→13ms; Part 2 8-chip TP 13ms→3.4ms (3.8× cached, blog rounds to 4.3×); Part 3 50-tok decode 130.9s DynamicCache eager → 88.4s StaticCache eager → 14.77s StaticCache+jit (8.9×); Part 4 **A100 GPU, not TPU**: 5.9s→1.07s/image after VAE `methods_to_compile=['decode']` fix.
- **HF API drift flagged:** Part 3 post text's `StaticCache` pytree flattener (`cache.key_cache`/`cache.value_cache`) does NOT match the companion `jax_hg_03.py` (`cache.layers[i].keys`/`.values`). Script is current-HF-API version. Noted on codebase page and Part 3 source page. Candidate observation once a `model/` page exists.
- **Hardware ambiguity in Part 3:** post does not state device for the 130/88/14.77s numbers. Flagged in source-page "Gaps & caveats". Resolving this is a prerequisite before using those numbers as a baseline.
- **Part 4 hardware is A100 GPU.** Kept ingested because the `torchax.compile` / `CompileOptions` / `methods_to_compile` / scheduler-move patterns are TPU-portable, but reported numbers are not. Explicitly flagged on both the codebase page and Part 4 source page.
- Performance-relevant surfaces on the codebase page enumerate 10 concrete anchors (sharding recipe, KV-cache post-prefill sharding, functional_call escape from captured-constants, methods_to_compile override, static_argnames routing, scheduler tensor-move, pytree cookbook, static-arg strategies, default_matmul_precision, profile-capture idiom) — each grounded in a specific file:line.
- No hypotheses / concept stubs filed — no `model/` page yet to attach them to. Per-page "Future hypothesis anchors" sections carry the candidates forward.

## [2026-04-22] ingest-codebase | Wave 1 — seven repos

**Op**: ingest-codebase (batch)
**Pages created**: wiki/codebases/{xprof,xprof-mcp,torchax,tokamax,stablehlo,scaling-book,autoresearch}.md
**Pages updated**: wiki/index.md
**Key result**: 7 codebase parent pages written in parallel. Total 935 lines. Commit SHAs recorded in each page's frontmatter.
**Notes**:
- Per-repo "discuss before writing" step was batched into a single up-front categorization with the human (A=direct ingest, B=methodology, C=book-as-sources) rather than seven separate discussions.
- Scope discipline held: codebase pages map structure; the docs under each repo's `docs/` were deferred to Wave 2 (profiling/optimization) and Wave 3 (scaling-book chapters as sources). No source/concept/hypothesis pages created.
- Noteworthy findings surfaced during ingestion, flagged for follow-up when hypotheses are formulated:
  - **tokamax**: TPU `gated_linear_unit` and `layer_norm` have NO TPU-specific kernel — they silently fall back to the XLA reference. Candidate hypothesis source.
  - **tokamax**: splash-attention backward-pass block sizes (`block_q_dkv`, `block_kv_dkv`, `block_kv_dkv_compute`, `block_q_dq`, `block_kv_dq`) are exposed via `SplashConfig` but NOT surfaced to the autotuner (hidden tuning surface). Note: a Splash Attention kernel is also available upstream in JAX at `jax.experimental.pallas.ops.tpu.splash_attention` — the tokamax copy under `_src/ops/experimental/tpu/splash_attention/` mirrors that implementation, so hypothesis-writers can target either entry point.
  - **tokamax**: `ring_attention_kernel` exists but isn't reachable from `tokamax.dot_product_attention`.
  - **torchax**: `torchax.compile()` modes `dynamo` and `export` raise; only `jax` mode is functional.
  - **scaling-book**: book dated 2025-02-04 → Wave 3 source slugs will use `2025-` prefix, not `2026-`.
- **autoresearch** page uses the reframed H2 title **"Structural surfaces we borrow"** in place of "Performance-relevant surfaces" (the repo is methodology, not TPU-perf content). This is an intentional schema deviation for this single page.

## [2026-04-22] manual | wiki bootstrap

**Op**: manual
**Pages created**: SCHEMA.md, CLAUDE.md, wiki/index.md, wiki/log.md
**Pages updated**: —
**Key result**: —
**Notes**: Bootstrapped autoresearch-oriented schema from scratch. Independent of sibling `tpu_wiki` by design. Loop: sources + codebases + profiles → concepts + models → ranked hypotheses → experiments → observations → revised priors. Next: ingest first codebase and/or file the first model page.

## [2026-06-27] start-experiment | Qwen3-8B JAX Ring Attention (v012)

**Op**: start-experiment
**Pages updated**: wiki/experiments/qwen3_ag_autoresearch_optimization/jax/experiments/2026-06-27-qwen3-jax-v012-ring-attention.md
**Key result**: Successfully trained seqlen=8192 with Ring Attention / Splash Attention, 2D FSDP, and batch size 8 across 4 chips.
**Notes**:
- **Implementation fixes**:
  - Enabled 2D FSDP () in  to prevent HBM OOM by dropping local optimizer state size from 41GB to 20.5GB.
  - Fixed a cross-entropy bug in  where  on the logits broke the 2D tensor sharding and triggered a massive 9GB all-gather across the  dimension.
  - Reduced default  Pallas block sizes (, , ) from 2048 to 1024. This prevented a VMEM (SRAM) OOM () during the backward pass compilation.
- **Performance outcome**: The model achieved an MFU of **22.8%** with an average throughput of 31797 tok/s (3975 tok/s/chip) at .
- **Next step**: The 22.8% MFU is lower than the previous single-chip baseline. This regression needs to be profiled to understand the communication overhead of  and tile size efficiency.

## [2026-06-27] start-experiment | Qwen3-8B JAX Ring Attention (v012)

**Op**: start-experiment
**Pages updated**: wiki/experiments/qwen3_ag_autoresearch_optimization/jax/experiments/2026-06-27-qwen3-jax-v012-ring-attention.md
**Key result**: Successfully trained seqlen=8192 with Ring Attention / Splash Attention, 2D FSDP, and batch size 8 across 4 chips.
**Notes**:
- **Implementation fixes**:
  - Enabled 2D FSDP `("fsdp", "sp")` in `sharding.py` to prevent HBM OOM by dropping local optimizer state size from 41GB to 20.5GB.
  - Fixed a cross-entropy bug in `train.py` where `.reshape(-1, v)` on the logits broke the 2D tensor sharding and triggered a massive 9GB all-gather across the `sp` dimension.
  - Reduced default `splash_attn.py` Pallas block sizes (`SPLASH_BQ_DKV`, `SPLASH_BKV_DKV`, `SPLASH_BKV_DKV_COMPUTE`) from 2048 to 1024. This prevented a VMEM (SRAM) OOM (`34.96M > 32.00M`) during the backward pass compilation.
- **Performance outcome**: The model achieved an MFU of **22.8%** with an average throughput of 31797 tok/s (3975 tok/s/chip) at `seqlen=8192`.
- **Next step**: The 22.8% MFU is lower than the previous single-chip baseline. This regression needs to be profiled to understand the communication overhead of `sp=2` and tile size efficiency.
