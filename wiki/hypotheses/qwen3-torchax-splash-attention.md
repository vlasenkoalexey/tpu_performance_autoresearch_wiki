# Qwen3 torchax — splash attention

*Hypothesis*: Replacing the XLA-through-HF `scaled_dot_product_attention` with the
TPU **splash attention** Pallas kernel (GQA-native, 32q/8kv) eliminates the
`[B, n_heads, S, S]` score materialization, cutting attention HBM traffic and
removing the OOM that blocks seq 8192 on the minimal trainer.

*Mechanism*: Override `F.scaled_dot_product_attention` with the splash kernel
(canonical torchax pattern, bridged via `torchax.interop.call_jax`), mesh-sharded
`P('fsdp','tp',_,_)`. GQA is native — do not `repeat` K/V. Qwen3 applies QK-norm
before RoPE; the kernel sees post-norm post-RoPE Q/K, so no kernel change needed.

*Predicted signal*: attention's share of the step drops; the 66% TC idle in the
[baseline](../experiments/qwen3_ag_autoresearch_optimization/torchax/experiments/2026-06-02-qwen3-torchax-v6e8-baseline.md)
shrinks; seq 4096/8192 become runnable without OOM.

*Falsification criterion*: no measurable step-time improvement at seq 2048 **and**
still OOMs at seq 8192 → refuted.
